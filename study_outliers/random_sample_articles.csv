Therefore, it is important to categorize climbing injuries to the wrist, analyze risk factors, and assess treatment outcomes. Purpose: To evaluate the distribution, outcomes, and influencing factors of wrist injuries in climbers. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Climbing athletes with wrist injuries who presented to our specialized sports medical center over the course of 4 years (2017-2020) were selected. All had prospectively completed questionnaires including their climbing-specific background (years of training, climbing level, training methods, etc). Injuries were analyzed (International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation [UIAA] grade and diagnosis), and treatment methods and outcomes were retrospectively assessed with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Parameters included the climbing score, visual analog scale for pain score, Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score, and shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) score including the sport component (DASH–Sport) score before and after treatment as well as time to return to climbing. Results: A total of 69 patients (25 female, 44 male) with 78 wrist injuries were identified and analyzed. Of these, 7 injuries were bilateral, occurring at the same time, and 2 injuries were independent reinjuries to either the same or the contralateral side. In addition, 24 injuries (30.8%) were acute, while 54 (69.2%) were chronic. Overall, 2 injuries had a UIAA grade of 3; all others had a UIAA grade of 2. The most frequent injuries were synovitis of the ulnocarpal recess, ulnar impaction, bone marrow edema of the lunate, wrist sprains (joint capsular pain with stress, with no pathological finding on magnetic resonance imaging), and wrist ganglion cysts. Nonoperative treatment was performed for 61 of the injuries, while 17 were treated surgically. In 51 cases (65.4%), injuries healed without consequences; in 27 cases (34.6%), discomfort remained. The visual analog scale pain score decreased from 4.8 ± 1.9 before treatment to 0.7 ± 1.0 after treatment (P <.001), the PRWE score decreased from 53.6 ± 24.9 to 10.3 ± 13.1 (P <.001), the QuickDASH score improved from 53.0 ± 16.6 to 20.0 ± 20.2 (P <.001), and the DASH–Sport score improved from 82.0 ± 16.1 to 38.1 ± 23.5 (P <.001). The climbing score improved from 2.5 ± 1.1 to 4.3 ± 1.0 points (P <.001). The patient-reported number of days with pain was negatively correlated with changes in the PRWE score (r = −0.351; P <.001), QuickDASH score (r = −0.316; P =.007), and climbing score (r = −0.264; P =.025) as well as the number of days without climbing (r = −0.266; P =.025). The number of days without climbing was positively correlated with changes in the PRWE score (r = 0.369; P <.001). Conclusion: Wrist injuries in climbers constituted a diverse set of diagnoses. Ulnar-sided injuries were most common, and many patients had >1 diagnosis. Outcomes for all treatment methods (surgery and nonoperative care) were favorable, but approximately one-third of climbers had persistent wrist discomfort after treatment, underscoring the need for accurate diagnoses and acute and expert care. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173792464,49,0,,SPSS

However, the source of that pain is undetermined. Purpose/Hypothesis: We aimed to determine if there is a differential expression of nerve fibers around the glenoid labrum and if torn labra have increased neuronal expression compared with untorn labra (rotator cuff repair labra). We hypothesized that the superior labrum would have a higher concentration of neurofilament than would the rest of the labrum and that the concentration of neurofilament would increase at the site of a labral tear. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Seven labra were sampled at the 3-, 5-, 9-, and 12-o’clock positions during total shoulder arthroplasty. Samples were also collected at the 3-, 5-, and 12-o’clock positions during rotator cuff repair (16 labra), anterior labral repair (6 labra), type II superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) repair (4 labra), and capsular release for idiopathic capsulitis (5 labra). Sections were immunostained with antibodies to neurofilament, a specific neuronal marker that is used to identify central and peripheral nerve fibers, and the concentration and intensity of immunostained-positive cells assessed. Results: The concentration of neurofilament staining was similar in the superior, anterior, posterior, and inferior glenoid labrum in untorn labra (8 neurofilament expressing cells per square millimeter; P =.3). Torn labra exhibited a 3- to 4-fold increase in neuronal expression, which was isolated to the location of the tear in SLAP (P =.09) and anterior labral tears (P =.02). The concentration of neurofilament expressing cells in torn glenoid labrum samples was comparable that in with the glenoid labrum of adhesive capsulitis samples (P =.7). Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that after a tear of the anterior or superior labrum the labrum in that region becomes populated with new nerves fibers and that these fibers may be responsible for the pain noted by patients with superior (SLAP) and/or anterior labral (Bankart) tears. Clinical Relevance: This study suggests that neural infiltration contributes to the pain experienced by patients with labral tears. It may help with patient education and direct future management of labral lesions. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146567787,321,0,,SPSS

It is well-established that meniscus root tears lead to decreased femorotibial contact area, increased peak contact pressures, and increased stress on the articular cartilage. Purpose: To evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of the all-inside meniscus root repair procedure and compare it with the previously described transtibial technique. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Nine paired cadaveric knees were prepared by removing skin, subcutaneous tissues, quadriceps muscles, patella, and patellar tendon, while leaving the capsule in place. Pressure-mapping sensors were inserted, and specimens underwent compressive loading to obtain peak pressures, mean pressures, and femorotibial contact area in the medial and lateral compartments. Tests were performed as static compression tests with the knee locked at 0° of flexion. Compression testing was performed in 3 states: meniscus intact, meniscus root cut, and after meniscus root repair with an all-inside repair technique. Additionally, testing was completed on 9 pairs of cadaveric knees to compare stiffness and maximal load to failure between the all-inside and transtibial meniscus root repair techniques. Results: In the medial compartment, there were significant increases in median peak pressures and median mean pressures in the root cut state as compared with the intact state (+636 kPA [95% CI, 246 to 1026] and +190 kPA [95% CI, 49 to 330], respectively). All-inside meniscus root repair restored median peak pressures and median mean pressures to approach those of the intact meniscus (+311 kPA [95% CI, –79 to 701] and +137 kPA [95% CI, –3 to 277]). In the lateral compartment, there were also significant increases in median peak pressures and median mean pressures in the root cut state as compared with the intact state (+718 kPA [95% CI, 246 to 1191] and +203 kPA [95% CI, 51 to 355]). All-inside meniscus root repair restored median peak pressures and median mean pressures such that they were not significantly different from the intact state (+322 kPA [95% CI, –150 to 795] and +18 kPA [95% CI, –134 to 171]). There was no difference between repair techniques regarding load to failure (P =.896). Transtibial meniscus root repair had significantly more stiffness (mean ± SD, 24.8 ± 9.3 N/mm) as compared with the all-inside meniscus root repair technique (13.6 ± 3.8 N/mm, P =.015). Conclusion: All-inside meniscus root repair reduced median peak and mean pressures to those of the native intact meniscus with the knee in extension in the cadaveric model. When compared with a transtibial meniscus root repair technique, all-inside repair demonstrated decreased stiffness and a similar load to failure. Clinical Relevance: All-inside meniscus root repair restored mean and peak femorotibial pressures to those of the intact meniscus. Additionally, it offers a technically easier technique for management of meniscus root tears. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163375531,153,1,"Box plots, no handling.",R

To improve clinical outcomes, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of MPFL elongation patterns. Purpose: To assess MPFL length changes in healthy knees from 0° to 90° of dynamic flexion and their relationship with anatomic parameters of the patellofemoral joint. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Dynamic computed tomography scans of an active flexion-extension-flexion movement in 115 knees from 63 healthy participants were evaluated to construct knee joint models. Using these models, the MPFL length was measured as the shortest wrapping path from the Schöttle point on the femur to 3 insertion points on the superomedial border of the patella (proximal, central, and distal). MPFL length changes (%) relative to the length in full extension were calculated, and their correlations with the tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove distance, Caton-Deschamps index, and lateral trochlear inclination were analyzed. Results: The proximal fiber was the longest in full extension and progressively decreased to a median length of −6.0% at 90° of flexion. The central fiber exhibited the most isometric pattern during knee flexion, showing a median maximal decrease of 2.8% relative to the full extension length and no evident elongation. The distal fiber first slightly decreased in length but increased at deeper flexion angles. The median overall length changes were 4.6, 4.7, and 5.7 mm for the proximal, central, and distal patellar insertion, respectively. These values were either not or very weakly correlated with the tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove distance, Caton-Deschamps index, and lateral trochlear inclination when the anatomic parameters were within the healthy range. Conclusion: The median MPFL length changed by approximately 5 mm between 0° and 90° of flexion. Proximally, the length continuously decreased, indicating slackening behavior. Distally, the length increased at deeper flexion angles, indicating tightening behavior. Clinical Relevance: In MPFL reconstruction techniques utilizing the Schöttle point to establish the femoral insertion, one should avoid distal patellar insertion, as it causes elongation of the ligament, which may increase the risk for complications due to overloading. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176962456,74,0,,MATLAB

Although good clinical outcomes are often obtained in the short term, poor clinical outcomes sometimes occur because of subchondral bone deterioration. The condition of the subchondral bone treated with MF may affect the repair of the osteochondral unit. Purpose: To analyze histological findings of the osteochondral unit after performing MF on subchondral bone in different states—normal, absorption, and sclerosis—in a rat model. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Full-thickness cartilage defects (5.0 × 3.0 mm) were created in the weightbearing area of the medial femoral condyle in both knees of 47 Sprague-Dawley rats. Five MF holes were created within the cartilage defect using a 0.55-mm needle to a depth of 1 mm at 0 weeks (normal group), 2 weeks (absorption group), and 4 weeks (sclerosis group) after the cartilage defect was created. In the left knee, MF holes were filled with β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). At 2 and 4 weeks after MF, knee joints were harvested and histologically analyzed. Results: MF holes were enlarged at 2 weeks and further enlarged at 4 weeks in all groups. In the absorption group, osteoclast accumulation around the MF holes and cyst formation were observed. The trabecular bone surrounding the MF holes was thickened in the sclerosis group. The diameter of the MF hole was largest in the absorption group at 2 and 4 weeks after MF compared with the other groups. No subchondral bone cysts were observed after β-TCP implantation. Pineda scores in all groups were significantly better with β-TCP implantation than without β-TCP implantation at 2 and 4 weeks. Conclusion: MF for subchondral bone with bone absorption induced enlargement of the MF holes, cyst formation, and delay of cartilage defect coverage. Implantation of β-TCP into the MF holes enhanced remodeling of the MF holes and improved repair of the osteochondral unit compared with MF only. Therefore, the condition of the subchondral bone treated with MF affects repair of the osteochondral unit in a cartilage defect. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85162640730,228,0,,

A Pediatric Cadaveric Study of Tibial Spine Fracture Repairs,2023,American Journal of Sports Medicine,51,10,NA,2589,2595,6,3,10.1177/03635465231181059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163647264&doi=10.1177%2f03635465231181059&partnerID=40&md5=7f8926e8ca14fb56dbf79c052e066dfb,"Background: Tibial spine fractures are common in the pediatric population because of the biomechanical properties of children’s subchondral epiphyseal bone. Most studies in porcine or adult human bone suggest that suture fixation performs better than screw fixation, but these tissues may be poor surrogates for pediatric bone. No previous study has evaluated fixation methods in human pediatric knees. Purpose: To quantify the biomechanical properties of 2-screw and 2-suture repair of tibial spine fracture in human pediatric knees. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Cadaveric specimens were randomly assigned to either 2-screw or 2-suture fixation. A standardized Meyers-Mckeever type 3 tibial spine fracture was induced. Screw-fixation fractures were reduced with two 4.0-mm cannulated screws and washers. Suture-fixation fractures were reduced by passing 2 No. 2 FiberWire sutures through the fracture fragment and the base of the anterior cruciate ligament. Sutures were secured through bony tunnels over a 1-cm tibial cortical bridge. Each specimen was mounted at 30° of flexion. A cyclic loading protocol was applied to each specimen, followed by a load-to-failure test. Outcome measures were ultimate failure load, stiffness, and fixation elongation. Results: Twelve matched pediatric cadaveric knees were tested. Repair groups had identical mean (8.3 years) and median (8.5 years) ages and an identical number of samples of each laterality. Ultimate failure load did not significantly differ between screw (mean ± SD, 143.52 ± 41.9 7 N) and suture (135.35 ± 47.94 N) fixations (P =.760). Screws demonstrated increased stiffness and decreased elongation, although neither result was statistically significant at the.05 level (21.79 vs 13.83 N/mm and 5.02 vs 8.46 mm; P =.076 and P =.069, respectively). Conclusion: Screw fixation and suture fixation of tibial spine fractures in human pediatric tissue were biomechanically comparable. Clinical Relevance: Suture fixations are not biomechanically superior to screw fixations in pediatric bone. Pediatric bone fails at lower loads, and in different modes, compared with adult cadaveric bone and porcine bone. Further investigation into optimal repair is warranted, including techniques that may reduce suture pullout and “cheese-wiring” through softer pediatric bone. This study provides new biomechanical data regarding the properties of different fixation types in pediatric tibial spine fractures to inform clinical management of these injuries. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163647264,146,0,,"G*Power, R"

Purpose: To evaluate clinical outcomes after acetabular microfracture performed during FAI surgery in a prospective, multicenter cohort. Study Design: Cohort Study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Patients with FAI who had failed nonoperative management were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter cohort. Preoperative and postoperative (mean follow-up, 4.3 years) patient-reported outcome measures were obtained with a follow-up rate of 81.6% (621/761 hips), including 54 patients who underwent acetabular microfracture. Patient characteristics, radiographic parameters, intraoperative disease severity, and operative procedures were analyzed. Propensity matching using linear regression was used to match 54 hips with microfracture to 162 control hips (1:3) to control for confounding variables. Subanalyses of hips ≤35 and >35 years of age with propensity matching were also performed. Results: Patients who underwent acetabular microfracture were more likely to be male (81.8% vs 40.9%; P <.001), be older in age (35.0 vs 29.9 years; P =.001), have a higher body mass index (27.2 vs 25.0; P =.001), and have a greater alpha angle (69.6° vs 62.3°; P <.001) compared with the nonmicrofracture cohort (n = 533). After propensity matching to control for covariates, patients treated with microfracture displayed no differences in the modified Harris Hip Score or Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (P =.22-.95) but were more likely to undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA) (13% [7/54] compared with 4% [6/162] in the control group; P =.002), and age >35 years was associated with conversion to THA after microfracture. Microfracture performed at or before 35 years of age portended good outcomes with no significant risk of conversion to THA at the most recent follow-up. Conclusion: Microfracture of acetabular cartilage defects appears to be safe and associated with reliably improved short- to mid-term results in younger patients; modified expectations should be realized when full-thickness chondral lesions are identified in patients >35 years of age. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165615429,122,0,,

Previous studies using polydioxanone suture cerclage augments for CC ligament reconstruction demonstrated poor clinical and biomechanical outcomes. Tape-style sutures have recently gained popularity because of their added stiffness and strength relative to traditional sutures. These tape cerclage systems have yet to be biomechanically studied in CC ligament reconstruction. Purpose: To determine the efficacy of a tape cerclage system as an augment to CC ligament reconstruction. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 24 human cadaveric shoulders were utilized. These were divided into 4 repair groups: anatomic CC ligament reconstruction (ACCR), ACCR with a tape cerclage augment (ACCR + C), tendon graft sling with a cerclage augment (TGS + C), or tape cerclage sling alone (CS). The repairs underwent superior/inferior cyclic loading to evaluate for displacement. Specimens were visually inspected for cortical erosion by the tape cerclage after cyclic loading. Finally, the constructs underwent superior plane load-to-failure testing. Results: Less displacement after cyclic loading was observed in the ACCR + C (mean ± SD, 0.42 ± 0.32 mm), TGS + C (0.92 ± 0.42 mm), and CS (0.93 ± 0.39 mm) groups as compared with the ACCR group (4.42 ± 3.40 mm; P =.002). ACCR + C (813.3 ± 257.5 N), TGS + C (558.0 ± 120.7 N), and CS (759.5 ± 173.7 N) demonstrated significantly greater load at failure relative to ACCR (329.2 ± 118.2 N) (P <.001). ACCR + C (60.88 ± 17.3 N/mm), TGS + C (44.97 ± 9.15 N/mm), and CS (54.52 ± 14.24 N/mm) conferred greater stiffness than ACCR (27.43 ± 6.94 N/mm) (P =.001). No cortical erosion was demonstrated in any specimen after cyclic loading. Conclusion: In a cadaveric model at time zero, repairs utilizing a tape cerclage system confer significantly greater load to failure and stiffness, as well as decreased displacement with cyclic loading, when compared with traditional ACCR repair. Clinical Relevance: Tape cerclage augmentation may provide a useful augment for CC ligament reconstruction. © 2022 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85142649966,372,0,,SPSS

The majority of the ACL-Rp techniques recommend the use of a synthetic brace. The use of the gracilis allows both a biological internal brace and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALR). Purpose: The primary objective was to compare the early ability to return to sports between patients who underwent ACL-Rp using a gracilis autograft as an internal brace augmentation with ALR and patients who underwent the conventional ACL-Rc with ALR technique sacrificing both the gracilis and the semitendinosus. The secondary objective was to compare the failure rate, clinical scores, and return to sports at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Study design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective analysis was undertaken. A total of 49 patients who underwent ACL-Rp with ALR between December 2018 and May 2019 were propensity matched at a 1:1 ratio to those who underwent ACL-Rc with ALR during the same period. The decision to perform ACL-Rp with ALR was based on preoperative selection and intraoperative arthroscopic findings: proximal avulsion tear, partial ACL tear, low- to midlevel sports participation, and good tissue quality. The ability to return to sports was assessed using isokinetic tests and the Knee Santy Athletic Return to Sport test functional test at 6 months postoperatively. At the final follow-up, knee laxity parameters, return to sports, and clinical outcome (Lysholm score, Tegner Activity Scale score, International Knee Documentation Committee score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Return to Sport after Injury score) were recorded. Results: The ACL-Rp group had significantly less hamstring strength deficit when compared with their counterparts who underwent ACL-Rc (0.2% vs 10.2% in concentric, P <.001; 2.5% vs 14% in eccentric, P <.001). The mean Knee Santy Athletic Return to Sport test score was significantly higher in the ACL-Rc group (69.7% ± 16.6% [range, 19%-100%] vs 61% ± 16.8% [range, 19%-100%]; P =.001). In the ACL-Rp group, 61% (30/49) of the patients were authorized to return to pivot sports versus 41% (20/49) in the ACL-Rc group (P =.04). At a mean final follow-up of 31.4 ± 3.5 months, no significant differences were demonstrated between groups with respect to clinical scores and knee laxity parameters. There was a trend for a higher failure rate in the ACL-Rp group without any significance (ACL-Rp: 6.1% [3/49] vs ACL-Rc: 0%; P =.08). Conclusion: At 6 months after operation, harvesting only the gracilis with this ACL-Rp and augmentation with ALR technique was linked to a better early ability to return to sports compared with the ACL-Rc with ALR technique harvesting both the gracilis and semitendinosus. This technique had a limited effect on early flexion strength and provided a satisfactory rerupture rate. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167331111,128,0,,XLSTAT Addinsoft

The biological gap-bridging effect of a PRF scaffold alone or in combination with rabbit ligamentocytes on primary ACL healing was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Hypothesis: A PRF matrix can be implanted as a provisional fibrin-platelet bridging scaffold at an ACL defect to facilitate functional healing. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: The biological effects of PRF on primary rabbit ligamentocyte proliferation, tenogenic differentiation, migration, and tendon-specific matrix production were investigated for treatment of cells with PRF-conditioned medium (PRFM). Three-dimensional (3D) lyophilized PRF (LPRF)–cell composite was fabricated by culturing ligamentocytes on an LPRF patch for 14 days. Cell-scaffold interactions were investigated under a scanning electron microscope and through histological analysis. An ACL midsubstance tear model was established in 3 rabbit groups: a ruptured ACL was treated with isolated suture repair in group A, whereas the primary repair was augmented with LPRF and LPRF-cell composite to bridge the gap between ruptured ends of ligaments in groups B and C, respectively. Outcomes—gross appearance, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological analysis—were evaluated in postoperative weeks 8 and 12. Results: PRFM promoted cultured ligamentocyte proliferation, migration, and expression of tenogenic genes (type I and III collagen and tenascin). PRF was noted to upregulate cell tenogenic differentiation in terms of matrix production. In the 3D culture, viable cells formed layers at high density on the LPRF scaffold surface, with notable cell ingrowth and abundant collagenous matrix depositions. Moreover, ACL repair tissue and less articular cartilage damage were observed in knee joints in groups B and C, implying the existence of a chondroprotective phenomenon associated with PRF-augmented treatment. Conclusion: Our PRF-augmented strategy can facilitate the formation of stable repair tissue and thus provide gap-bridging in ACL repair. Clinical Relevance: From the translational viewpoint, effective primary repair of the ACL may enable considerable advancement in therapeutic strategy for ACL injuries, particularly allowing for proprioception retention and thus improved physiological joint kinematics. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147772092,303,0,,GraphPad Prism

Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of glenoid concavity, as represented by the bony shoulder stability ratio (BSSR) and other factors, including glenoid bone defect size, on the surgical failure of arthroscopic stabilization procedures for recurrent anterior shoulder instability. The authors also aimed to determine the critical value of BSSR. It was hypothesized that both glenoid concavity and glenoid bone defect size would be correlated with surgical failure, with glenoid concavity having a stronger correlation. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 120 patients who underwent arthroscopic stabilization procedures for recurrent anterior shoulder instability were included. Patients with bony Bankart lesions were excluded to eliminate the postoperative effects of bony fragment restoration on the glenoid concavity. For each patient, variable factors including BSSR, glenoid bone defect size, presence of off-track Hill-Sachs lesions, and age at first dislocation were recorded. Chi-square analysis and Student t test were performed to analyze the effect of each variable on surgical failure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the combined effect of >2 variables on surgical failure. The critical value of BSSR was analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: Nine patients (7.5%) had recurrent instability requiring revision surgery. BSSR (patients with recurrence, 18.6% ± 19.4%; patients without recurrence, 41.8% ± 10.5%; P =.01), glenoid bone defect size (17.5% ± 3.6% vs 11.7% ± 7.0%; P =.02), age at the time of first dislocation (18.8 ± 3.9 years vs 22.0 ± 6.5 years; P =.04), and number of suture anchors used (4.1 ± 0.3 vs 5.8 ± 1.6; P <.001) showed significant differences between patients with and without surgical failure. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed surgical failure to be correlated with BSSR (odds ratio, 0.849; P =.02) and the number of suture anchors used (odds ratio, 0.070; P =.03). The critical value of BSSR was 29.3% (area under the curve, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.00; P <.001; sensitivity, 78%; specificity, 93%). Conclusion: Glenoid concavity is strongly correlated with surgical failure after arthroscopic stabilization procedures for anterior shoulder instability. The value of BSSR reflects shoulder instability caused by glenoid bone morphology more accurately than glenoid bone defect size. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174405660,24,0,,SPSS

Current treatment options include arthroscopic debridement, microfracture, autograft or allograft osteochondral transplantation, and cell-based therapies such as autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Osteochondral transplantation techniques restore the normal topography of the condyles and provide mature hyaline cartilage in a single-stage procedure. However, clinical outcomes comparing autograft versus allograft techniques are scarce. Purpose: To perform a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of high-quality studies to evaluate the results of osteochondral autograft and allograft transplantation for the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using various databases. Inclusion criteria were level 1 or 2 original studies, studies with patients reporting knee cartilage injuries and chondral defects, mean follow-up ≥2 years, and studies focusing on osteochondral transplant techniques. Exclusion criteria were studies with nonknee chondral defects, studies reporting clinical outcomes of osteochondral autograft or allograft combined with other procedures, animal studies, cadaveric studies, non–English language studies, case reports, and reviews or editorials. Primary outcomes included patient-reported outcomes and failure rates associated with both techniques, and factors such as lesion size, age, sex, and the number of plugs transplanted were assessed. Metaregression using a mixed-effects model was utilized for meta-analyses. Results: The search resulted in 20 included studies with 364 cases of osteochondral autograft and 272 cases of osteochondral allograft. Mean postoperative survival was 88.2% in the osteochondral autograft cohort as compared with 87.2% in the osteochondral allograft cohort at 5.4 and 5.2 years, respectively (P =.6605). Patient-reported outcomes improved by an average of 65.1% and 81.1% after osteochondral autograft and allograft, respectively (P =.0001). However, meta-analysis revealed no significant difference in patient-reported outcome percentage change between osteochondral autograft and allograft (P =.97) and a coefficient of 0.033 (95% CI, –1.91 to 1.98). Meta-analysis of the relative risk of graft failure after osteochondral autograft versus allograft showed no significant differences (P =.66) and a coefficient of 0.114 (95% CI, –0.46 to 0.69). Furthermore, the regression did not find other predictors (mean age, percentage of female patients, lesion size, number of plugs/grafts used, and treatment location) that may have significantly affected patient-reported outcome percentage change or postoperative failure between osteochondral autograft versus allograft. Conclusion: Osteochondral autograft and allograft result in favorable patient-reported outcomes and graft survival rates at medium-term follow-up. While predictors for outcomes such as mean age, percentage of female patients, lesion size, number of plugs/grafts used, and treatment location did not affect the comparison of the 2 cohorts, proper patient selection for either procedure remains paramount to the success and potentially long-term viability of the graft. © 2022 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124621151,327,0,,R

It is thought to directly represent the position of the TT on the tibia. Recent work has shown that the measurement of the TT-TG distance is multifactorial. Purpose: To investigate the relationship between relative tibial external rotation (rTER) and trochlear dysplasia (TD), as well as the location of the TG and TT in patients with and without PI, and to correlate these and other anatomic measurements with the TT-TG distance. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 89 patients with PI who underwent magnetic resonance imaging were identified with 92 matched control patients. A standardized measurement protocol on axial magnetic resonance imaging determined rTER, the proximal and distal TG lateralization (pTGL and dTGL, respectively) ratios, and the TT lateralization (TTL) ratio. Other measures of interest included the lateral trochlear inclination angle, sulcus angle, and lateral patellar inclination angle. Univariate regression was used to determine the associations of TD (lateral trochlear inclination angle, sulcus angle) with rTER and the TG position, and multivariate regression was used to model associations among all the variables with the proximal and distal TT-TG distances. Results: rTER was significantly higher in the study group (P <.001), and univariate regression showed a significant association between dysplasia measures and rTER (P <.001). The pTGL ratio was lower in the study group (P =.025), but there was no difference in the dTGL ratio (P =.090) or the TTL ratio (P =.098) between the groups. There were no associations between dysplasia measures and the pTGL and dTGL ratios (P >.05). Multivariate regression showed that the proximal TT-TG distance is predicted by the sulcus angle, pTGL ratio, rTER, and TTL ratio (P <.05) and that the distal TT-TG distance is predicted by the lateral patellar inclination angle, dTGL ratio, sulcus angle, rTER, and TTL ratio (P <.05). Conclusion: rTER had a significant association with TD. The position of the proximal TG was more medial in patients with PI. There was no significant difference in the TTL ratio between patients with and without PI. The TT-TG distance was associated with multiple anatomic measures and was not solely predicated on the position of the TT. © 2022 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141021325,356,0,,

It is uncertain whether this trend applies to countries that traditionally prefer an initial nonoperative treatment approach whenever possible, like Norway. Nationwide, long-term patient-reported outcomes and revision rates after ACLR in the pediatric population are also lacking. Purpose: To determine the incidence of pediatric ACLR in Norway since 2005, as well as to detect trends in surgical details and describe patient-reported outcomes up to 10 years after ACLR. Study Design: Descriptive cohort study. Methods: This study is based on prospectively collected data on girls ≤14 years and boys ≤16 years, registered in the Norwegian Knee Ligament Register at the time of their primary ACLR, between 2005 and 2021. The main outcome was the incidence of ACLR, adjusted to the corresponding population numbers for each year. The time trend was analyzed by comparing the mean of the first and last 3-year period (2005-2007 and 2019-2021). Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score preoperatively and at 2, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. Results: A total of 1476 patients (1484 cases) were included, with a mean follow-up of 8.1 years (range, 1-17). The incidence of pediatric ACLRs per 100,000 population increased from 18 to 26, which corresponds to an increase of 40% for boys and 55% for girls. Concurrent meniscal procedures increased significantly from 45% to 62%, and the proportion of meniscal repairs increased from 19% to 43% when comparing the first and last time period. The mean Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score values for the Sport and Recreation and Quality of Life subscales were between 72 and 75 at the 2-, 5- and 10-year follow-up. The 5-year revision rate was 9.9%. Conclusion: There was a major increase in incidence of pediatric ACLR in Norway during the study period. There was a shift in the approach to concomitant meniscal procedures from resection to repair, with more than a doubling of the proportion of meniscal repairs. Patient-reported outcomes revealed long-lasting reduced knee function. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165966674,89,0,,"STATA, SPSS, SPC Excel, R"

Purpose: To determine if MRI scans improve inter- or intrarater reliabilities over radiographs for findings of hip arthritis. Study Design: Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Anteroposterior and cross-table lateral radiographs as well as a representative coronal and sagittal T2-weighted MRI scan were reviewed for 50 patients by 7 experienced subspecialty hip preservation surgeons, with a minimum experience of 10 years. Radiographs and MRI scans were assessed for joint space narrowing, subchondral cysts, osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, Likert osteoarthritis grade (none, mild, moderate, or severe), and Tönnis grade. MRI scans were also evaluated for bony edema, heterogeneous articular cartilage, and chondral defects. Inter- and intrarater reliabilities were calculated utilizing the Fleiss method with a 95% CI. Results: The scans of 50 patients (28 female and 22 male) with a mean age of 42.8 years (SD, 14.2 years; range, 19-70 years) were reviewed. Radiographs revealed fair agreement for joint space narrowing (κ = 0.25 [95% CI, 0.21-0.30]), osteophytes (κ = 0.26 [95% CI, 0.14-0.40]), Likert osteoarthritis grading (κ = 0.33 [95% CI, 0.28-0.37]) and Tönnis grade (κ = 0.30 [95% CI, 0.26-0.34). Radiographs revealed moderate agreement for subchondral cysts (κ = 0.53 [95% CI, 0.35-0.69]). MRI scans demonstrated poor to fair agreement for joint space narrowing (κ = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.09-0.21]), subchondral sclerosis (κ = 0.27 [0.19-0.34]), heterogeneous articular cartilage (κ = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.00-0.14]), Likert osteoarthritis grade (κ = 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]), and Tönnis grade (κ = 0.20 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]). MRI scans demonstrated substantial agreement for subchondral cysts (κ = 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63-0.83]). Intrarater reliabilities were statistically improved compared with interrater reliabilities, but no differences were found between radiographs and MRI scans for joint space narrowing, subchondral cysts, osteophytes, osteoarthritis grade, or Tönnis grade. Conclusion: Radiographs and MRI scans had substantial limitations and inconsistency between raters in evaluating common markers of hip osteoarthritis. MRI scans demonstrated strong reliability in evaluating for subchondral cysts but did not improve the interobserver variability of grading hip arthritis. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159113853,165,0,,R

However, few studies have investigated histological and molecular changes after injection. Purpose: To compare the effectiveness of intra-articular injections of triamcinolone and HA in a frozen shoulder rat model and verify a greater effect of triamcinolone in passive shoulder abduction compared with HA. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 4 groups (n = 5 in each): control group, which did not receive cast immobilization or injection, and 3 experimental groups, which received 3 weeks of unilateral shoulder immobilization followed by intra-articular injections (normal saline, triamcinolone, or HA) at the immobilized shoulder. Passive shoulder abduction angle, histological and immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting results were assessed 2 weeks after injection. The intensity and extent of staining were converted to semiquantitative scores for further analysis. Results: Shoulder abduction angles before sacrifice were 153.0°± 2.7° (control group), 107.0°± 5.7° (saline group), 139.0°± 9.6° (triamcinoline group), and 110.0°± 10.6° (HA group), showing significant differences between control and saline groups, control and HA groups, saline and triamcinoline groups, and triamcinoline and HA groups (P <.001) but not between control and triamcinoline groups (P =.053). Histologic evaluation revealed an increase in synovial folds and thickening of the capsular membrane in the saline and HA groups; this change was not evident in the triamcinolone group. A comparison of semiquantitative scores revealed greater expression levels of proteins involved in fibrosis and angiogenesis in the saline and HA groups compared with the control and triamcinolone groups. In Western blotting, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the receptor for advanced glycation end products was significantly lower in the triamcinolone and HA groups than in the saline group. Conclusion: Triamcinolone injection was more effective than normal saline or HA injection in improving range of motion and reversing fibrotic and angiogenic features of frozen shoulder. Both triamcinolone and HA injections elicited anti-inflammatory effects. Clinical Relevance: The antifibrotic and antiangiogenic properties of triamcinolone and the anti-inflammatory properties of both triamcinolone and HA should be considered when performing injections in clinical settings. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167415646,110,0,,"G*Power, R"

Nerve release at the suprascapular notch might alleviate this problem. Purpose: To evaluate the effects of the transverse scapular ligament (TSL) release in patients with large to massive RCTs with more severe FD of the infraspinatus than the supraspinatus. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Between September 2017 and January 2022, arthroscopic TSL release with rotator cuff repair was performed in patients with large to massive RCTs and more severe FD of the infraspinatus muscle than the supraspinatus muscle (TSL group). Cuff integrity, FD, and atrophy of cuff muscles were evaluated using preoperative and 1-year postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, results were compared with those of patients who did not undergo TSL release during arthroscopic large to massive rotator cuff repair (NTSL group). Results: A total of 103 patients—20 in the TSL group and 83 in the NTSL group—were included. Group preoperative characteristics, including tear size and supraspinatus FD, were not significantly different, but infraspinatus FD (TSL vs NTSL; grade, 0-4, 0/0/5/10/5 vs 1/33/42/4/3) and atrophy (grade, 1-3. 3/9/8 vs 56/20/7) differed significantly (P <.001). Healing failure occurred in 13 of 20 (65%) patients in the TSL group and 30 of 83 (36%) patients in the NTSL group, which was a statistically significant difference (P =.019). Postoperatively, infraspinatus FD and atrophy were more severe in the TSL group than in the NTSL group (P <.001), and supraspinatus FD was more severe in the TSL group (P =.029). Seven patients in the TSL group achieved healing, but FD and atrophy of the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus showed no improvement in this group (all, P >.05). Conclusion: In patients with more FD in the infraspinatus than the supraspinatus muscle, TSL release appeared to have no benefit for cuff healing or FD reversal in cuff muscles. The possibility of suprascapular nerve entrapment remains in patients with more FD in the infraspinatus than the supraspinatus, and this potential nerve problem is not properly addressed by TSL release alone. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176356911,20,0,,SPSS

Purpose: The primary purpose was to assess radiographic measures of coronal-plane alignment, longitudinal growth, patellar congruence, and trochlear dysplasia after MPFLR in a skeletally immature population. A secondary purpose was to assess this population compared with a matched cohort with a focus on trochlear dysplasia prevalence and the effect of MPFLR on patellar height. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 28 children with a minimum 1-year follow-up who underwent isolated MPFLR were identified. All patients were skeletally immature, defined as fully open physes on both sides of the knee joint, at the time of surgery. The development of a limb length discrepancy or angular growth abnormalities were assessed on standing hip-to-ankle radiographs, patellar tilt and congruence were measured on the Merchant view of the knee, and the grade of trochlear dysplasia and patellar height were assessed on lateral knee radiographs. A sex- and age-matched group of patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was formed as a control for patellar height and trochlear dysplasia measurements. Results: The mean patient age was 11.71 ± 2.02 years at the time of surgery with a mean follow-up of 23.54 ± 12.49 months. All but 1 patient in the MPFLR group had preoperative features consistent with trochlear dysplasia. There was no significant difference in limb length or coronal-plane alignment at final follow-up (P =.725 and P >.999, respectively). Both the MPFLR and the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction groups had a statistically significant decrease in the Caton-Deschamps index between the preoperative and postoperative time points (mean, 0.18 ± 0.20 and 0.11 ± 0.14, respectively; P =.161). Conclusion: MPFLR may be safely performed utilizing an epiphyseal femoral socket in a skeletally immature cohort without affecting normal longitudinal growth or coronal limb alignment. The previously reported effect of MPFLR in reducing patellar height may be related to physiological growth based on similar changes noted in a comparison cohort that did not undergo the procedure. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147498056,297,0,,

However, no study has investigated the effect of graft extrusion on the articular cartilage using objective quantitative methods. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to investigate the influence of graft extrusion on the chondroprotective effect of lateral MAT on knee articular cartilage. We hypothesized that MAT without graft extrusion would result in better cartilage quality than MAT with graft extrusion. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Altogether, 105 patients who underwent isolated lateral MAT were divided into the extrusion and nonextrusion groups based on postoperative 3-month magnetic resonance imaging. Quantitative T2 mapping was performed on pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging at midterm follow-up (mean ± SD, 3.2 ± 0.7 years). The weightbearing area of the femoral and tibial plateau articular cartilage was divided into 6 segments (F1, F2, F3, TP1, TP2, and TP3) from the anterior to posterior direction according to the meniscal coverage area. Each segment was further segmented into superficial and deep layers for zonal analysis. Longitudinal change in cartilage T2 value was compared between the groups. Lysholm scores were used to evaluate clinical function. Results: The mean T2 value of the nonextrusion group showed a significant improvement in 14 of 18 segments after lateral MAT, whereas the extrusion group demonstrated no statistically significant change. The biochemical properties of cartilage tissue as judged by quantitative T2 mapping indicated improvement in the nonextrusion group as compared with the extrusion group in the F2, TP2, and TP3 segments overall; the deep layers of the F1, F2, and TP2 segments; and the superficial layer of the TP3 segment (P <.05). Conclusion: This study shows that the nonextruded graft results in better cartilage properties of the knee joint after lateral MAT as compared with the extruded graft at midterm follow-up. © 2023 The Author(s).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146069515,359,0,,SPSS

Methods: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients undergoing primary MAT at a single institution from 1999 to 2016. Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales were collected before surgery and at a minimum of 5-year follow-up. A distribution-based approach was used to calculate MCID, whereas an anchor-based approach was used to calculate SCB and PASS. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine factors associated with CSO achievement. Results: A total of 202 patients undergoing MAT (56% medial, 44% lateral) were included with a mean follow-up of 9.8 ± 4.1 years, age of 29.7 ± 8.5 years, and body mass index (BMI) of 26.5 ± 4.7. Thresholds for achieving MCID, PASS, and SCB, respectively, at a minimum 5-year follow-up for Lysholm (10.3, 74.5, 32.5), IKDC (12.1, 55.6, 29.1), and KOOS subscales questionnaires (Pain [11.0, 70.7, 25.1], Symptoms [11.0, 60.8, 19.6], Activities of Daily Living [10.5, 90.3, 17.9], Sport [16.2, 47.4, 37.5], and Quality of Life [13.6, 40.5, 37.3]) were calculated. Reduced odds of achieving MCID were associated with higher preoperative PROM scores, BMI, patient age, concomitant osteotomy, male sex, and worker's compensation (WC) status. Reduced odds of achieving PASS were associated with lower preoperative PROM scores, higher BMI (particularly ≥30), patient age, and WC status. Reduced odds of achieving SCB were associated with higher preoperative PROM scores and WC status. Conclusions: This study established the MCID, PASS, and SCB at 5-year minimum follow-up for the Lysholm score, IKDC, and KOOS subscales in patients who underwent MAT. Increased BMI and patient age, male sex, performance of concomitant osteotomy, WC status, and preoperative PROM scores were associated with failure to achieve CSOs after primary MAT at a minimum of 5-year follow-up.

Methods: Twelve fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders were evaluated using a dynamic shoulder testing system. Humeral head translation, subacromial and glenohumeral contact pressures were compared among 4 conditions: 1) Intact, 2) Irreparable supra- and infraspinatus tendon tear, 3) SCR using acellular dermal allograft (ADA) fixation at 30° of abduction, and 4) SCR with ADA fixation at 45° of abduction. Results: SCR at both 30° (0.287 mm, CI: −0.480 - 1.05 mm; P < .0001) and 45° (0.528 mm, CI: −0.239-1.305 mm; P = .0006) significantly decreased superior translation compared to the irreparably torn state. No significant changes in subacromial peak contact pressure were observed between any states. The average glenohumeral contact pressure increased significantly following creation of an irreparable RCT (373 kPa, CI: 304-443 vs 283 kPa, CI 214-352; P = .0147). The SCR performed at 45° (295 kPa, CI: 226-365, P = .0394) of abduction significantly decreased the average glenohumeral contact pressure compared to the RCT state. There was no statistically significant difference between the average glenohumeral contact pressure of the intact state and SCR at 30° and 45°. Conclusion: SCR improved the superior stability of the glenohumeral joint when the graft was secured at 30° or 45° of glenohumeral abduction. Fixation at 45° of glenohumeral abduction provided more stability than did fixation at 30°. Clinical Relevance: Grafts attached at 45° of glenohumeral abduction biomechanically restore the glenohumeral stability after SCR using ADA better than fixation at 30° of glenohumeral abduction. © 2022 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85146136201,481,0,,R

Residual femoroacetabular impingement deformity after arthroscopy is a leading cause of failure, and it is therefore critical to perform a thorough fluoroscopic and dynamic assessment when addressing cam deformities arthroscopically. The fluoroscopic assessment uses 6 anteroposterior views, including 3 in hip extension (30° internal rotation, neutral rotation, and 30° external rotation) and 3 in 50° flexion (neutral rotation, 40° external rotation, 60° of external rotation), performed before, during, and after the femoral resection. The dynamic assessment includes evaluation of impingement-free range of motion and “end feel” (a subjective description of the tactile feedback during assessment of hip motion), and should be performed before and after the femoral resection in 3 specific positions (extension/abduction, flexion/abduction, and flexion/internal rotation). Although the anterior aspect of the head–neck junction is readily accessed through standard arthroscopic portals with the hip in 30 to 50° of flexion, the posterolateral, posteromedial, and posterior extent of the femoral head–neck junction are challenging to address. The natural external rotation of the proximal femur during flexion and internal rotation during extension can be used to gain posterior lateral and medial access. Antero/posteromedial femoral access can be obtained with >50° of hip flexion with the burr in the anteromedial portal. Posterolateral femoral access is achieved with hip extension with the burr in the anterolateral portal, and further posterolateral access can be achieved with the addition of traction, allowing resection of posterolateral deformities extending beyond the lateral retinacular vessels while remaining proximal to the vessels. This comprehensive intraoperative fluoroscopic and dynamic assessment and surgical [Formula presented]technique can lead to a predictable correction of most cam-type deformities. © 2023 Arthroscopy Association of North America",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171142285,377,0,,

Methods: A modified consensus technique was conducted among 26 elbow surgeons and 3 physical therapists/athletic trainers. Strong consensus was defined as 90% to 99% agreement. Results: Of the 19 total questions and consensus statements 4 achieved unanimous consensus, 13 achieved strong consensus, and 2 did not achieve consensus. Conclusions: There was unanimous agreement that the risk factors include overuse, high velocity, poor mechanics, and previous injury. There was unanimous agreement that advanced imaging in the form of either magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance arthroscopy should be performed in a patient presenting with suspected/known UCL tear that plans to continue to play an overhead sport, or if the imaging study could change the management of the patient. There was unanimous agreement regarding lack of evidence for the use of orthobiologics in the treatment of UCL tears as well as the areas pitchers should focus on when attempting a course of nonoperative management. The statements that reached unanimous agreement for operative management were regarding operative indications and contraindications for UCL tears, prognostic factors that should be taken into consideration in when performing UCL surgery, how to deal with the flexor–pronator mass during UCL surgery, and use of an internal brace with UCL repairs. Statements that reached unanimous agreement for return to sport (RTS) were regarding portions of the physical examination should be considered when determining whether to allow a player to RTS; unclear how velocity, accuracy, and spin rate should be factored into the decision of when players can RTS and sports psychology testing should be used to determine whether a player is ready to RTS.

Methods: From March 2018 to January 2020, 57 CLAI patients were prospectively included with arthroscopic all-inside anatomic reconstruction (n = 31) or open anatomic reconstruction (n = 26) with gracilis tendon autograft. The patients were evaluated before operation and at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after surgery. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS), visual analog scale (VAS), and Karlsson-Peterson score were evaluated at each time point, and stress radiography with a Telos device was performed before surgery and at final follow-up. The time to return to full weightbearing walking, jogging, sports, and work, Tegner activity score, and complications were recorded and compared. Results: All the subjective scores significantly improved after surgery from the preoperative level. Compared with the open group, the arthroscopic group demonstrated significantly earlier return to full weightbearing walking (8.9 vs 11.7 weeks, P < .001), jogging (17.9 vs 20.9 weeks, P = .012), and recreational sports (22.4 vs 26.5 weeks, P = .001) with significantly better AOFAS score and Karlsson score at 3 to 6 months, and better VAS score at 6 months after surgery. The 2 groups demonstrated no significant difference in the surgical duration or surgical complications. No significant difference was found in the clinical scores or stress radiographic measurements at 24 months after surgery (P > .05). Conclusion: Compared with the open procedure, the arthroscopic all-inside anatomic lateral ankle ligament reconstruction with autologous gracilis tendon could achieve earlier return to full weightbearing, jogging, and recreational sports with less pain and better ankle functional scores at 3 to 6 months after surgery. Similar favorable short-term clinical outcomes were achieved for both techniques at 2 years after surgery.

Methods: Following institutional review board approval, patients who underwent primary repair for quadriceps tendon rupture with TO or SA techniques between January 2009 and August 2018 were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively reviewed. Patients were contacted for satisfaction (1-10 scale), current function (0-100 scale), failure (retear), and revision surgeries; International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) were also collected to achieve a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Results: Sixty-four patients (34 SA, 30 TO) were available by phone or e-mail at a mean of 4.81 ± 2.60 years postoperatively. There were 10 failures, for an overall failure rate of 15.6%. Failure incidence did not significantly differ between treatment groups (P = .83). Twenty-seven patients (47% of nonfailed patients) had completed patient-reported outcomes. The SA group reported higher subjective function (SA: 90 [85-100] vs TO: 85 [60-93], 95% CI of difference: –19.9 to –2.1 × 10–5, P = .042), final IKDC (79.6 [50.0-93.6] vs 62.1 [44.3-65.5], 95% CI of difference: –33.0 to –0.48, P = .048), KOOS Pain (97.2 [84.7-97.2] vs 73.6 [50.7-88.2], 95% CI of difference: –36.1 to –3.6 × 10–5, P = .037), Quality of Life (81.3 [56.3-93.8] vs 50.0 [23.4-56.3], 95% CI of difference: –50.0 to –6.2, P = .026), and Sport (75.0 [52.5-90.0] vs 47.5 [31.3-67.5], 95% CI of the difference: –45.0 to –4.1 × 10–5, P = .048). Conclusions: There is no significant difference in failure rate between transosseus and suture anchor repairs for quadriceps tendon ruptures (P = .83). Most failures occur secondary to a traumatic reinjury within the first year postoperatively. Despite the lack of difference in failure rates, at final follow-up, patients who undergo suture anchor repair may report significantly greater subjective function and final IKDC, KOOS Pain, Quality of Life, and Sport scores.

Eleven elite adolescent male rugby league players volunteered to participate in this study (mean ± SD, age; 18.5 ± 0.5 years, height; 179.5 ± 5.0 cm, body mass; 88.3 ± 13.0 kg). Participants performed a drill encompassing four blocks of six tackling (i.e. tackling an opponent) and six tackled (i.e. being tackled by an opponent while carrying a ball) events (i.e. 48 total tackles) while wearing a micro-technological inertial measurement unit (WIMU, Realtrack Systems, Spain). The acceleration data were used to calculate sample entropy (SampEn) to analyse the movement variability during tackles performance. In tackling actions SampEn showed significant between-position differences in block 1 (p = 0.0001) and block 2 (p = 0.0003). Significant between-block differences were observed in backs (block 1 vs 3, p = 0,0021; and block 1 vs 4, p = 0,0001) but not in forwards. When being tackled, SampEn showed significant between-position differences in block 1 (p = 0.0007) and block 3 (p = 0.0118). Significant between-block differences were only observed for backs in block 1 vs 4 (p = 0,0025). Movement variability shows a progressive reduction with cumulative tackle events, especially in backs and when in the defensive role (tackling). Forwards present lower movement variability values in all blocks, particularly in the first block, both in the attacking and defensive role. Entropy measures can be used by practitioners as an alternative tool to analyse the temporal structure of variability of tackle actions and quantify the load of these actions according to playing position. © 2023 Institute of Sport.

This study aimed to determine differences in BC and LA among soccer across four performance levels. The study involved 110 male soccer players participating in Czech senior teams who were grouped into four different performance levels (i.e. G1: national team, G2: 1st division, G3: 2nd division, G4: 3rd division). The following BC and LA parameters were compared among groups: body height, body mass, absolute fat-free mass, relative fat-free mass (FFMrel), percentage of fat mass (FM), total body water (TBW), intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW), phase angle, and bilateral muscle mass differences in the upper and lower extremities. Significant differences were observed in BC parameters among all groups (λ = 0.06, F75,246 = 5.38, p = 0.01, ηp2 = 0.62). High-performance players (i.e. G1, G2) had significantly (p < 0.01) lower FM than lower performance players (i.e. G3, G4). The lowest values of FFMrel, relative TBW, relative ICW and ECW were detected in the lowest-performance players (i.e. G4). Significantly lower bilateral muscle mass differences were detected in G1 players (2.71 ± 1.26%; p < 0.01) compared with G4 players (3.95 ± 1.17%). G1 and G2 players had a higher proportion of muscle mass in the torso (p < 0.01) and upper limbs than G3 and G4 (p < 0.01). Elite and high-performance players have better BC and lower inter-limb anthropometric asymmetries compared with low-performance level players. © 2023 Institute of Sport.

The data were obtained from 24 teams (BFLTs; n = 14, N-BFLTs; n = 10) during the UEFA Champions League (UCL) matches (n = 20) in the 2020/21 season using a semiautomatic video system. The differences in MRP between BFLTs and N-BFLTs, while controlling for contextual factors, were examined using linear mixed model. No differences in overall MRP between fullbacks, central midfielders, wide midfielders and forwards from BFLTs and their peers from N-BFLTs were found, while only central defenders from BFLTs covered more high-intensity running than central defenders from BFLTs (moderate effects size). For players on all playing positions from BFLTs, total- and low-intensity distance covered were lower in offensive phase of game and greater in defensive phase of game compared to their peers from N-BFLTs (all large effect sizes). This study demonstrated that the most elite match-play in soccer is characterized by increased efforts in defensive phase of game, and decreased efforts in offensive phase of game.

Retrospective data from 36 team-seasons (16 elite teams performing in top European leagues) were analyzed (627 players, 96 non-contact time loss match hamstring injuries). We described 1) the occurrence of > 85%, > 90% or > 95% MSS exposures during training within each turnaround and match hamstring injuries and 2) whether the above-mentioned injury occurrences differed depending on the day(s) of the turnarounds (i.e., the period separating two consecutive matches, which is generally from 3 to 8 days) when these speed exposures occurred. The longer the length of the turnarounds and the lower the speed thresholds, the greater the number (and proportion) of near-to-MSS exposures (e.g., 18%, 45% and 72% of turnarounds with > 85% runs for 3, 5 and 7-turnarounds, respectively). For half of the turnarounds examined, there were no match hamstring injuries when players were exposed to running bouts > 95% MSS during training (e.g., injury rates: 0; CI: 0-15). Injuries still occurred during 85% of the turnarounds when there were no or lower relative speed exposures (i.e., > 85 or > 90%, injury rates: 2-5, CI: 0-6). Finally, irrespective of the turnaround length, there were no match hamstring injuries when > 95% MSS exposures occurred at D-2, while in contrast, injuries still happened when players were not exposed at all, or when these exposures occurred at D-3 and/or earlier within the turnaround. While the present observational study design precludes the examination of causal relationships, the programming of > 95% MSS exposures at D-2 may help mitigate match hamstring injury occurrences in elite football. © 2023 Institute of Sport.

For this within-participant unilateral and contralateral experimental design, fourteen untrained young males performed a unilateral knee extension exercise (KE), and a unilateral leg press (LP) exercise in a counterbalanced order. At pre-, post-, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h after exercise, the peak torque (PT), unilateral countermovement jump (uCMJ) performance, and rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscle thicknesses were recorded in both legs. The PT decreased immediately after (p = 0.01) both exercises (KE and LP) and was fully recovered 24 h after KE (p = 0.38) and 48 h after LP (p = 0.68). Jump height and power, in the uCMJ, followed the same PT recovery pattern after both exercises. However, vertical stiffness (Kvert) was not affected at any time point after both protocols. The RF thickness increased after both exercises (p = 0.01) and was fully restored 48 h after KE (p = 0.86) and 96 h after LP (p = 1.00). The VL thickness increased after both exercises (p = 0.01) and was fully restored 24 h after LP (p = 1.00) and 48 h after KE (p = 1.00). The LP exercise, compared to KE, induced more prolonged impairment of functional performance and delayed recovery of RF muscle edema. However, the VL edema-induced muscle swelling recovery was delayed after the KE exercise. The different recovery kinetics between functional performance and muscle damage should be taken into consideration depending on the objectives of the next training sessions. © 2023 Institute of Sport.

Sixteen wheelchair athletes participated in this study and were classified according to their type of physical impairment and health condition as follows: athletes with neurological impairment (ANI, n = 5) and athletes with impaired muscle power (IMP, n = 11). In addition, six non-disabled participants formed a control group (CG, n = 6). All the participants performed the isometric propulsion strength test (IPST), evaluating pushing and pulling actions, and two wheelchair performance tests. Excellent relative intra-session reliability scores were obtained for strength values for the ANI, IMP and CG groups (0.90 < ICC < 0.99) and absolute reproducibility showed acceptable scores of SEM (< 9.52%) for IPST pushing action. The ANI had significantly lower scores in strength and wheelchair performance than the IMP and the CG, while no differences were found between the IMP and the non-disabled participants. In addition, no correlations were found for wheelchair athletes between the isometric upper limb strength measure and wheelchair performance. Our findings suggest that the IPST is a valid test for strength measurement in upper limb impairment wheelchair athletes with different health conditions, which must be used in combination with a performance test to obtain a holistic assessment of this population. © 2023 Institute of Sport.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and therapeutic factors associated with increased survival, stratified by clinical stage, in order to determine the optimal treatment. Methods The study was a retrospective analysis involving 117 patients with histologically confirmed CCS, between July 2016 and November 2017, who were enrolled in the Bone and Soft Tissue Tumour Registry in Japan. Results The five- and ten-year survival rates were 41% (95% confidence interval (CI) 29 to 52) and 37% (95% CI 25 to 49), respectively. On multivariable analysis, the size of the tumour of > 10 cm (p = 0.006), lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis (p < 0.001), distant metastases at the time of diagnosis (p < 0.001), and no surgery for the primary tumour (p = 0.019) were independently associated with a poor survival. For N0M0 CCS (n = 68), the development of distant metastases was an independent prognostic factor for survival (early (< 12 months), hazard ratio (HR) 116.78 (95% CI 11.69 to 1,166.50); p < 0.001; late (> 12 months), HR 14.79 (95% CI 1.66 to 131.63); p = 0.016); neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.895) and/or radiotherapy (p = 0.216) were not significantly associated with survival. The five-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 19% (95% CI 8 to 35) and the size of the tumour was significantly associated with an increased rate of local recurrence (p = 0.012). For N1M0 CCS (n = 18), the risk of mortality was significantly lower in patients who underwent surgery for both the primary tumour and lymph node metastases (HR 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.56); p = 0.020). For M1 CCS (n = 31), excision of the primary tumour was independently associated with better survival (HR 0.26 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.76); p = 0.013). There was no significant difference in survival between the different types of systemic treatment (p = 0.523). Conclusion Complete excision of the primary tumour and lymph nodes is associated with a better survival in patients with CCS. Systemic treatment appears to provide limited benefits, demonstrating a pressing need for novel systemic agents. © 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175878256,646,0,,"SPSS, R"

This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated five-year follow-up results comparing cemented ATTUNE and PFC-Sigma cruciate retaining TKAs, analyzing component migration as measured by radiostereometric analysis (RSA), clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and radiological outcomes. Methods A total of 74 primary TKAs were included in this single-blind RCT. RSA examinations were performed, and PROMs and clinical outcomes were collected immediate postoperatively, and at three, six, 12, 24, and 60 months’ follow-up. Radiolucent lines (RLLs) were measured in standard anteroposterior radiographs at six weeks, and 12 and 60 months postoperatively. Results At five-year follow-up, RSA data from 61 patients were available and the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) of the femoral components were: ATTUNE: 0.96 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.14) and PFC-Sigma 1.37 mm (95% CI 1.18 to 1.59) (p < 0.001). The PFC-Sigma femoral component migrated more in the first postoperative year, but stabilized thereafter. MPTM of the tibial components were comparable at five-year follow-up: ATTUNE 1.12 mm (95% CI 0.95 to 1.31) and PFC-Sigma 1.25 mm (95% CI 1.07 to 1.44) (p = 0.438). RLL at the medial tibial implant-cement interface remained more prevalent for the ATTUNE at five-year follow-up compared to the PFC-Sigma (20% vs 3%). RLL did not progress over time, and varied between patients at different timepoints for both TKA systems. Clinical outcomes and PROMs improved compared with preoperative scores, and were not different between groups. Conclusion MTPM migration at five-year follow-up of the femoral and tibial component of the ATTUNE were similar and as low as that of the PFC-Sigma. MTPM migration of both knee implants did not significantly change from one year post-surgery, indicating stable fixation. Long-term ATTUNE performance may be expected to be comparable to the clinically well-performing PFC-Sigma. We have not found evidence of increased tibial component migration as measured by RSA to support concerns about cement debonding and a higher risk of aseptic loosening with the ATTUNE TKA. © 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175877810,674,0,,"SPSS, R"

It has been described in the literature that patients who smoke are approximately twice as likely to develop a nonunion following a non-specific bone fracture. For clavicle fractures, this risk is unclear, as is the impact that such a complication might have on the initial management of these fractures. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for conservatively treated displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Cochrane Library) were searched from inception to 12 May 2022, with supplementary searches in Open Grey, ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and Google Scholar. The searches were performed without limits for publication date or languages. Results The meta-analysis included eight studies, 2,285 observations, and 304 events (nonunion). The random effects model predicted a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 3.68 (95% confidence interval 1.87 to 7.23), which can be considered significant (p = 0.003). It indicates that smoking more than triples the risk of nonunion when a fracture is treated conservatively. Conclusion Smoking confers a RR of 3.68 for developing a nonunion in patients with a displaced middle third clavicle fracture treated conservatively. We know that most patients with pseudarthrosis will have pain and a poor functional outcome. Therefore, patients should be informed of the significantly higher risks of nonunion and offered smoking cessation efforts and counselling. Moreover, surgery should be considered for any patient who smokes with this type of fracture. © 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164233393,706,0,,R

Current evidence on mortality and long-term outcomes is limited. The primary aim of this study was to assess the five-year mortality of CCS, and to determine any difference in mortality between management groups or age. Methods Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a traumatic CCS between January 2012 and December 2017 in Wales were identified. Patient demographics and data about injury, management, and outcome were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to assess mortality and between-group differences. Results A total of 65 patients were identified (66.2% male (n = 43), mean age 63.9 years (SD 15.9)). At a minimum of five years' follow-up, 32.3% of CCS patients (n = 21) had died, of whom six (9.2%) had died within 31 days of their injury. Overall, 69.2% of patients (n = 45) had been managed conservatively. There was no significant difference in age between conservatively and surgically managed patients (p = 0.062). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant difference in mortality between patients managed conservatively and those managed surgically (p = 0.819). However, there was a significant difference in mortality between the different age groups (< 50 years vs 50 to 70 years vs > 70 years; p = 0.001). At five years' follow-up, 55.6% of the patient group aged > 70 years at time of injury had died (n = 15). Respiratory failure was the most common cause of death (n = 9; 42.9%). Conclusion Almost one-third of patients with a traumatic CCS in Wales had died within five years of their injury.

Methods Four investigators evaluated 60 hip ultrasounds and assessed their quality based the standard plane of Graf et al. They measured geometric parameters, described the morphology of the hip, and assigned the Graf grade of dysplasia. They analyzed one self-selected image and one randomly selected image from the ultrasound series, and repeated the process four weeks later. The intra- and interobserver agreement, and correlations between various parameters were analyzed. Results In the assessment of quality, there a was moderate to substantial intraobserver agreement for each element investigated, but interobserver agreement was poor. Morphological features showed weak to moderate agreement across all parameters but improved to significant when responses were reduced. The geometric measurements showed nearly perfect agreement, and the relationship between them and the morphological features showed a dose response across all parameters with moderate to substantial correlations. There were strong correlations between geometric measurements. The Graf classification showed a fair to moderate interobserver agreement, and moderate to substantial intraobserver agreement. Conclusion This investigation into the reliability of the interpretation of hip ultrasound scans identified the difficulties in defining what is a high-quality ultrasound. We confirmed that geometric measurements are reliably interpreted and may be useful as a further measurement of quality. Morphological features are generally poorly interpreted, but a simpler binary classification considerably improves agreement. As there is a clear dose response relationship between geometric and morphological measurements, the importance of morphology in the diagnosis of hip dysplasia should be questioned. © 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174641013,656,0,,STATA

Methods A total of 97 patients with RHA were analyzed: 56 received a bipolar RHA (Group 1) while 41 received an anatomical implant (Group 2). Radiographs were performed postoperatively and after three, six, nine, and 12 weeks, six, nine, 12, 18, and 24 months, and annually thereafter. PRNR was measured in all radiographs in the four radial neck quadrants. The Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the abbreviated version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH), and the patient-assessed American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score - Elbow (pASES-E) were used for the clinical assessment. Radiological signs of implant loosening were investigated. Results The mean follow-up was six years (2 to 14). PRNR started after a mean of 7.5 weeks (SD 2.1) and progressed significantly during the first two years, by the end of which the bone resorption stabilized. PRNR was detected in 81% (n = 45) of patients in Group 1 and 88% (n = 36) in Group 2. The final mean PRNR was 3.0 mm (SD 2.3) in Group 1 and 3.7 mm (SD 2.5) in Group 2. The mean MEPS, QuickDASH, and pASES-E were 95.9 (SD 11.5), 4.4 (SD 9.2), and 94.8 (SD 10.9) in Group 1 and 92.2 (SD 16.2), 9.9 (SD 21.5), and 90.8 (SD 15) in Group 2, respectively. No significant differences were observed between groups in the clinical and radiological outcomes. No correlations were found between PRNR and the clinical results. Conclusion PRNR after press-fit RHA is a common radiological finding that develops in the first 24 months before stabilizing definitively. PRNR does not affect the clinical results or implant survival in the mid term. © 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166392693,753,0,,SPSS

The 2020 London International Hamstring Consensus meeting aimed to highlight clear surgical indications and to create a foundation for future research. A literature review was conducted followed by a modified Delphi process, with an international expert panel. Purposive sampling was used with two rounds of online questionnaires and an intermediate round involving a consensus meeting. The initial information gathering (round 1) questionnaire was sent to 46 international experts, which comprised open-ended questions covering decision-making domains in HSI. Thematic analysis of responses outlined key domains, which were evaluated by a smaller international subgroup (n=15) comprising clinical academic sports medicine physicians, physiotherapists and orthopaedic surgeons in a consensus meeting. After group discussion of each domain, a series of consensus statements were prepared, debated and refined. A round 2 questionnaire was sent to 112 international hamstring experts to vote on these statements and determine level of agreement. The consensus threshold was set a priori at 70% agreement. Rounds 1 and 2 survey respondents were 35/46 (76%) and 99/112 (88.4%), respectively. The consensus group agreed that the indications for operative intervention included: gapping at the zone of tendinous injury (87.2% agreement) and loss of tension (70.7%); symptomatic displaced bony avulsions (72.8%); and proximal free tendon injuries with functional compromise refractory to non-operative treatment (72.2%). Other important considerations for operative intervention included: the demands of the athlete/patient and the expected functional outcome (87.1%) based on the anatomy of the injury; the risk of functional loss/performance deficit with non-operative management (72.2%); and the capacity to restore anatomy and function (87.1%). Further research is needed to determine whether surgery can reduce the risk of reinjury as consensus was not reached within the whole group (48.2%) but was agreed by surgeons (70%) in the cohort. The consensus group did not support the use of corticosteroids or endoscopic surgery without further evidence. These guidelines will help standardise treatment of HSIs, specifically the indications and decision-making for surgical intervention.  © 2023 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148307121,867,1,Individually considered.,

Methods This cohort study nested within a randomised trial enrolled 1696 patients with surgically resected stage III colon cancer. Physical activity was calculated based on self-reporting during and after chemotherapy. Patients were classified as physically active (≥9 MET-h/wk, comparable with the energy expenditure of 150 min/wk of brisk walking, consistent with the current physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors) or physically inactive (<9 MET-h/wk). The confounder-adjusted hazard rate (risk of recurrence or death) and HR by physical activity category were estimated with continuous time to allow non-proportionality of hazards. Results During a median 5.9 years follow-up, 457 patients experienced disease recurrence or death. For physically active and physically inactive patients, the risk of disease recurrence peaked between 1 and 2 years postoperatively and declined gradually to year 5. The risk of recurrence in physically active patients never exceeded that of physically inactive patients during follow-up, suggesting that physical activity prevents - as opposed to delays - cancer recurrence in some patients. A statistically significant disease-free survival benefit associated with physical activity was observed during the first postoperative year (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.92). A statistically significant overall survival benefit associated with physical activity was observed during the first three postoperative years (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.51). Conclusions In this observational study of patients with stage III colon cancer, postoperative physical activity is associated with improved disease-free survival by lowering the recurrence rate within the first year of treatment, which translates into an overall survival benefit. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Methods This retrospective descriptive study included 11 420 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees and 312 883 non-athletes. Incidences of injuries and illnesses during the competition period from 21 July to 8 August 2021 were analysed. Results A total of 567 athletes (416 injuries, 51 non-heat-related illnesses and 100 heat-related illnesses) and 541 non-athletes (255 injuries, 161 non-heat-related illnesses and 125 heat-related illnesses) were treated at the competition venue clinic. Patient presentation and hospital transportation rates per 1000 athletes were 50 and 5.8, respectively. Marathons and race walking had the highest incidence of injury and illness overall (17.9%; n=66). The highest incidence of injury (per participant) was noted in boxing (13.8%; n=40), sport climbing (12.5%; n=5) and skateboarding (11.3%; n=9), excluding golf, with the highest incidence of minor injuries. Fewer infectious illnesses than previous Summer Olympics were reported among the participants. Of the 100 heat-related illnesses in athletes, 50 occurred in the marathon and race walking events. Only six individuals were transported to a hospital due to heat-related illness, and none required hospital admission. Conclusion Injuries and heat-related illnesses were lower than expected at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Summer Games. No catastrophic events occurred. Appropriate preparation including illness prevention protocols, and treatment and transport decisions at each venue by participating medical personnel may have contributed to these positive results.  © 2023 Author(s).

Method We conducted a six-season (2011/2012-2013/2014 and 2017/2018-2019/2020) prospective cohort study of time-loss match injuries in elite-level female players in the English Premiership competition. A 24-hour time-loss definition was used. Results Five-hundred and thirty-four time-loss injuries were recorded during 13 680 hours of match exposure. Injury incidence was 39 injuries per 1000 hours (95% CIs 36 to 42) with a mean severity of 48 days (95% CIs 42 to 54) and median severity of 20 days (IQR: 7-57). Concussion was the most common specific injury diagnosis (five concussions per 1000 hours, 95% CIs 4 to 6). The tackle event was associated with the greatest burden of injury (615 days absence per 1000 hours 95% CIs 340 to 1112), with 'being tackled' specifically causing the most injuries (28% of all injuries) and concussions (22% of all concussions). Conclusions This is the first multiple-season study of match injuries in elite women's rugby union players. Match injury incidence was similar to that previously reported within international women's rugby union. Injury prevention strategies centred on the tackle would focus on high-burden injuries, which are associated with substantial player time-loss and financial costs to teams as well as the high-priority area of concussions.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Methods 240 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years (M=11.64, SD=3.16) completed assessments from time of injury to 3 months postinjury. Separate linear mixed effects models were conducted for child and parent ratings on the PedsQL-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale to plot recovery across domains (General, Cognitive, Sleep/Rest) and Total fatigue, from 1 week to 3 months postinjury. Two-block hierarchical regression analyses were then conducted for parent and child ratings of fatigue at each time point, with age, sex and acute symptoms in block 1 and child and parent mental health variables added to block 2. Results There was a significant reduction in both child and parent ratings across the 3 months postinjury for all fatigue domains (all p<0.001). For both child and parent fatigue ratings, child mental health was the most significant factor associated with fatigue at all time points. Adding child and parent mental health variables in the second block of the regression substantially increased the variance explained for both child and parent ratings of fatigue. Conclusion Our findings confirm that fatigue improves during the first 3 months postconcussion and highlights the importance of considering child and parent mental health screening when assessing patients with persisting postconcussive symptoms.  © 2023 Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

Existing research is mired in confusion partly because stakeholders have not agreed on key primary cam morphology elements or a prioritised research agenda. We aimed to inform a more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based approach to research on primary cam morphology and its natural history by working towards agreement on a set of research priorities for conditions affecting the young person's hip. Methods An international expert panel - the Young Athlete's Hip Research (YAHiR) Collaborative - rated research priority statements through an online two-round Delphi exercise and met online to explore areas of tension and dissent. Panellists ranked the prioritised research statements according to the Essential National Health Research (ENHR) ranking strategy. Reporting of results followed REPRISE (REporting guideline for PRIority SEtting of health). Results A diverse Delphi panel (n=65, Delphi rounds 1 and 2; three ENHR strategy surveys: n=49; n=44; n=42) from 18 countries representing six stakeholder groups, prioritised and ranked 18 of 38 research priority statements. The prioritised statements outlined seven research domains: (1) best practice physiotherapy, (2) rehabilitation progression and return to sport, (3) exercise intervention and load management, (4) primary cam morphology prognosis and aetiology, (5) femoroacetabular impingement syndrome prognosis and aetiology, (6) diagnostic criteria, and (7) screening. The panel recommended areas of tension and dissent for the research community to focus on immediately. Conclusion While informing more rigorous, inclusive and evidence-based research, this consensus is a roadmap for researchers, policy-makers and funders to implement research dedicated to reducing the cost and burden of hip disease related to primary cam morphology.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Based on these results, in 2019, pexidartinib received accelerated approval in the United States in this population as a breakthrough therapy under an orphan drug designation. However, the ability of pexidartinib to relieve pain in ENLIVEN was not fully detailed, and the relationship between pain relief and objective tumor response was not described.Questions/purposes(1) What level of pain relief was achieved by pexidartinib treatment in ENLIVEN? (2) How was pain relief related to objective tumor responses? (3) How durable was pain relief?MethodsThe current study included planned primary and exploratory assessments of patient-assessed worst pain at the site of the tumor in the ENLIVEN trial. ENLIVEN was a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which adults with TGCT not amenable to improvement with surgery received pexidartinib or placebo for 24 weeks, after which eligible patients could receive open-label pexidartinib. Of 174 patients assessed for eligibility, 121 were randomized (50% [60] to placebo, 50% [61] to pexidartinib), and 120 were given either placebo or pexidartinib (59 received placebo and 61 received pexidartinib) and were included in an intent-to-treat analysis. Fifty-nine percent (71 of 120) of the overall treated population was female, and 88% (106 of 120) were White. Mean age was 45 ± 13 years. Tumors were mostly in the lower extremities (92% [110 of 120]), most commonly in the knee (61% [73 of 120]) and ankle (18% [21 of 120]). As a secondary outcome, patients scored worst pain at the site of the tumor in the past 24 hours on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). The primary definition of a pain response was a decrease of at least 30% in the weekly mean worst-pain NRS score and increase of less than 30% in narcotic analgesic use between baseline and week 25. Planned exploratory assessments of pain included the frequency of a pain response using alternative thresholds, including a decrease in worst-pain NRS score of 50% or more and a decrease of at least 2 points (minimum clinically important difference [MCID]), the magnitude of pain reduction between baseline and week 25, correlation between worst-pain NRS score and tumor shrinkage by RECIST 1.1 criteria, and the durability of the pain response during the open-label extension. Pain responses during the randomized portion of the trial were compared according to intention-to-treat analysis, with a one-sided threshold of p < 0.025 to reduce the risk of false-positive results. Pain assessment was complete for 59% (35 of 59) of patients in the placebo group and 54% (33 of 61) of patients in the pexidartinib group. Demographic and disease characteristics did not differ between the two treatment groups.ResultsA difference in the primary assessment of a pain response was not detected between pexidartinib and placebo (response percentage 31% [19 of 61] [95% CI 21% to 44%] versus 15% [9 of 59] [95% CI 8% to 27%]; one-sided p = 0.03). In the exploratory analyses, pexidartinib provided a modest improvement in pain (response percentage 26% [16 of 61] [95% CI 17% to 38%] versus 10% [6 of 59] [95% CI 5% to 20%]; one-sided p = 0.02 using the 50% threshold and 31% [19 of 61] [95% CI 21% to 44%] versus 14% [8 of 59] [95% CI 7% to 25%]; one-sided p = 0.02 using the MCID threshold). The least-squares mean change in the weekly mean worst-pain NRS score between baseline and week 25 was larger in patients treated with pexidartinib than placebo (-2.5 [95% CI -3.0 to -1.9] versus -0.3 [95% CI -0.9 to 0.3]; p < 0.001), although the mean difference between the two groups (-2.2 [95% CI -3.0 to -1.4]) was just over the MCID. Improvement in the weekly mean worst-pain NRS score correlated with the reduction in tumor size (r = 0.44; p < 0.001) and tumor volume score (r = 0.61; p < 0.001). For patients in the open-label extension, the change in the worst-pain NRS score from baseline was similar to the change at the end of the randomized portion and just above the MCID (mean -2.7 ± 2.2 after 25 weeks and -3.3 ± 1.7 after 50 weeks of receiving pexidartinib).ConclusionBased on the current study, a modest reduction in pain, just larger than the MCID, may be an added benefit of pexidartinib in these patients, although the findings are insufficient to justify the routine use of pexidartinib for pain relief.Level of EvidenceLevel II, therapeutic study. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A substantial proportion of patients will die within a few months of experiencing a hip fracture, but despite the importance of such documents, patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture seldom have discussions documented in the medical records regarding end-of-life care during their surgical admission. To the best of our knowledge, the proportion of patients older than 65 years treated with surgery for hip fractures who have advanced care planning documents in their electronic medical record (EMR) has not been explored, neither has the association between socioeconomic status and the presence of those documents in the EMR. Determining this information can help to identify opportunities to promote advanced care planning.Questions/purposes(1) What percentage of patients older than 65 years who undergo hip fracture surgery have completed advanced care planning documents uploaded in the EMR before or during their surgical hospitalization, or at any timepoint (before admission, during admission, and after admission)? (2) Are patients from distressed communities less likely to have advanced care planning documents in the EMR than patients from wealthier communities, after controlling for economic well-being as measured by the Distressed Communities Index? (3) What percentage of patients older than 65 years with hip fractures who died during their hospitalization for hip fracture surgery had advanced care planning documents uploaded in the EMR?MethodsThis was a retrospective, comparative study conducted at two geographically distinct hospitals: one urban Level I trauma center and one suburban Level II trauma center. Between 2017 and 2021, these two centers treated 850 patients for hip fractures. Among those patients, we included patients older than 65 years who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation, intramedullary nailing, hemiarthroplasty, or THA for a fragility fracture of the proximal femur. Based on that, 83% (709 of 850) of patients were eligible; a further 6% (52 of 850) were excluded because they had codes other than ICD-9 820 or ICD-10 S72.0, and another 2% (17 of 850) had incomplete datasets, leaving 75% (640 of 850) for analysis here. Most patients with incomplete datasets were in the prosperous Distressed Communities Index category. Among patients included in this study, the average age was 82 years, 70% (448 of 640) were women, and regarding the Distressed Communities Index, 32% (203 of 640) were in the prosperous category, 25% (159 of 640) were in the comfortable category, 15% (99 of 640) were in the mid-tier category, 5% (31 of 640) were in the at-risk category, and 23% (145 of 640) were in the distressed category. The primary outcome included the presence of advanced care planning documents (advanced directives, healthcare power of attorney, or physician orders for life-sustaining treatment) in the EMR before surgery, during the surgical admission, or at any time. The Distressed Communities Index was used to indicate economic well-being, and patients were identified as being in one of five Distressed Communities Index categories (prosperous, comfortable, mid-tier, at-risk, and distressed) based on ZIP Code. An exploratory analysis was conducted to determine variables associated with the presence of advanced care planning documents in the EMR. A multivariate regression was then performed for patients who did or did not have advanced care planning documents in their medical record at any time. The results are presented as ORs with the associated 95% confidence interval (CI).ResultsNine percent (55 of 640) of patients had advanced care planning documents in the EMR preoperatively or during their surgical admission, and 22% (142 of 640) of patients had them in the EMR at any time. After controlling for potential confounding variables such as age, laterality (left or right hip), hospital type, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, we found that patients in Distressed Communities Index categories other than prosperous had ORs lower than 0.7, with patients in the distressed category (OR 0.4 [95% CI 0.2 to 0.7]; p < 0.01) and comfortable category (OR 0.5 [95% CI 0.3 to 0.9]; p = 0.01) having a substantially lower odds of having advanced care planning documents in their EMR. Patients aged 86 to 95 years (OR 1.9 [95% CI 1.1 to 3.4]), those 96 years and older (OR 4.0 [95% CI 1.7 to 9.5]), and those with a higher ASA classification (OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.1 to 2.3]) had a higher odds of having advanced care planning documents in the EMR at any time. Among 14 patients who experienced in-hospital mortality, two had advanced care planning documents uploaded into their EMR, whereas 12 of 14 who died in the hospital did not have advanced care planning documents uploaded into their EMR.ConclusionOrthopaedic surgeons should counsel patients regarding the risk for postoperative complications after fragility hip fracture surgery and engage in shared decision-making regarding advanced care planning documents with patients or, if the patients are unable, with their families. Additionally, implementing virtual education about advanced care planning documents and using easy-to-read forms may facilitate the completion of advanced care planning documents by patients older than 65 years, especially patients with low economic well-being. Limitations of this study include having a restricted number of patients in the at-risk and mid-tier Distressed Communities Index categories and a restricted number of patients identifying as non-White races/ethnicities. Future research should evaluate the effect of advanced care document presence in the EMR on end-of-life care intensity in patients treated for fragility hip fractures.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This is in part because of the low prevalence of true fractures among suspected fractures, but also because of potentially misleading variations in signal that may be more common than fracture-related signal changes. To better understand the risk of overdiagnosis, we first need insight into the relative prevalence of useful and potentially distracting signal changes among patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture.Question/purposeWhat is the proportion of signal changes representing definite and possible scaphoid fractures relative to other types of signal changes on MRI among patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture?MethodsIn a retrospective study in an orthopaedic trauma clinic associated with a Level I trauma center, we evaluated MR images of patients 16 years and older with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture. At our institution, patients with symptoms and signs of a possible scaphoid fracture and negative radiographs undergo MRI scanning. Between January 1, 2012, and September 1, 2019, a total of 310 patients 16 years or older had an MRI to evaluate a suspected scaphoid fracture. Exclusion criteria included a scaphoid fracture that was visible on radiographs before MRI as reported by the radiologist (four patients), no available radiographs before MRI (two), MRI more than 3 weeks after injury (28), unknown date of injury (nine), and repeat or bilateral MRI scans (11), leaving 256 MR images for analysis. Sixty percent (153) of patients were women, and the median age was 34 years (IQR 21 to 50 years). The images were taken a median of 8 days (IQR 2 to 12 days) after injury. MR images were screened for the presence of scaphoid signal changes. We identified the following patterns of signal change with a reliability of kappa 0.62: definite scaphoid fracture, possible scaphoid fracture, signal in the waist area other than possible or definite fractures, and other signal changes. A definite scaphoid fracture was defined as a linear, focal, and bicortical signal abnormality, with adjacent edema and a relatively transverse orientation relative to the scaphoid long axis. The transverse linear signal was visible on more than one cut in multiple planes. A possible scaphoid fracture had a transverse linear signal on more than one cut on sagittal or coronal planes, with or without adjacent edema.ResultsSix percent (16 of 256) of MR images were categorized as revealing definite (2% [four of 256]) or possible (5% [12 of 256]) scaphoid fractures, whereas 29% (74 of 256) were categorized as revealing nonspecific signal changes at the waist (14% [35 of 256]) and other areas (15% [39 of 256]). Of the 51 patients with scaphoid waist signal changes, 69% (35) were categorized as having distracting and potentially misleading MRI findings.ConclusionThe high prevalence of signal changes that are distracting and potentially misleading, the low prevalence of signal changes that clearly represent a scaphoid fracture, and the low pretest odds of a true fracture among patients with a suspected scaphoid fracture illustrate that routine MRI of suspected scaphoid fractures carries a notable risk of overdiagnosis and potential overtreatment. Two alternative strategies are supported by preliminary evidence and merit additional attention: more-selective use of MRI in people deemed at higher risk according to a clinical prediction rule and strategies for involving the patient in decisions regarding how to manage the notably small risk of future symptomatic nonunion.Level of EvidenceLevel IV, diagnostic study. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Specifically, patients' racial backgrounds have been reported to influence outcomes after surgery, including length of stay, discharge disposition, and inpatient readmissions. However, in the United States, health-impacting socioeconomic disadvantage is sometimes associated with racial differences in ways that can result in important confounding, thereby raising the question of whether race-associated post-THA/TKA adverse outcomes are an independent function of race or a byproduct of confounding from socioeconomic deprivation, which is potentially addressable. To explore this, we used the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) as a proxy for socioeconomic disadvantage, since it is a socioeconomic parameter that estimates the likely deprivation associated with a patient's home address.Questions/purposesThe goal of this study was to investigate (1) whether race (in this study, Black versus White) was independently associated with adverse outcomes, including prolonged length of stay (LOS > 3 days), nonhome discharge, 90-day readmission, and emergency department (ED) visits while controlling for age, gender, BMI, smoking, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and insurance; and (2) whether socioeconomic disadvantage, measured by ADI, substantially mediated any association between race and any of the aforementioned measured outcomes.MethodsBetween November 2018 and December 2019, 2638 underwent elective primary THA and 4915 patients underwent elective primary TKA for osteoarthritis at one of seven hospitals within a single academic center. Overall, 12% (742 of 5948) of patients were Black and 88% (5206 of 5948) were White. We included patients with complete demographic data, ADI data, and who were of Black or White race; with these criteria, 11% (293 of 2638) were excluded in the THA group, and 27% (1312 of 4915) of patients were excluded in the TKA group. In this retrospective, comparative study, patient follow-up was obtained using a longitudinally maintained database, leaving 89% (2345 of 2638) and 73% (3603 of 4915) for analysis in the THA and TKA groups, respectively. For both THA and TKA, Black patients had higher ADI scores, slightly higher BMIs, and were more likely to be current smokers at baseline. Furthermore, within the TKA cohort there was a higher proportion of Black women compared with White women. Multivariable regression analysis was utilized to assess associations between race and LOS of 3 or more days, nonhome discharge disposition, 90-day inpatient readmission, and 90-day ED admission, while adjusting for age, gender, BMI, smoking, CCI, and insurance. This was followed by a mediation analysis that explored whether the association between race (the independent variable) and measured outcomes (the dependent variables) could be partially or completely attributable to confounding from the ADI (the mediator, in this model). The mediation effect was measured as a percentage of the total effect of race on the outcomes of interest that was mediated by ADI.ResultsIn the THA group, after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, smoking, CCI, and insurance, White patients had lower odds of experiencing an LOS of 3 days or more (OR 0.43 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.59]; p < 0.001) and nonhome discharge (OR 0.39 [95% CI 0.27 to 0.56]; p < 0.001). In mediation analysis, ADI partially explained (or mediated) 37% of the association between race and LOS of 3 days or more (-0.043 [95% CI -0.063 to -0.026]; p < 0.001) and 40% of the association between race and nonhome discharge (0.041 [95% CI 0.024 to 0.059]; p < 0.001). However, a smaller direct association between race and both outcomes was observed (LOS 3 days or more: -0.075 [95% CI -0.13 to -0.024]; p = 0.004; nonhome discharge: 0.060 [95% CI 0.016 to 0.11]; p = 0.004). No association was observed between race and 90-day readmission or ED admission in the THA group. In the TKA group, after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, smoking, CCI, and insurance, White patients had lower odds of experiencing an LOS of 3 days or more (OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.32 to 0.54]; p < 0.001), nonhome discharge (OR 0.44 [95% CI 0.33 to 0.60]; p < 0.001), 90-day readmission (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.39 to 0.77]; p < 0.001), and 90-day ED admission (OR 0.60 [95% CI 0.45 to 0.79]; p < 0.001). In mediation analysis, ADI mediated 19% of the association between race and LOS of 3 days or more (-0.021 [95% CI -0.035 to -0.007]; p = 0.004) and 38% of the association between race and nonhome discharge (0.029 [95% CI -0.016 to 0.040]; p < 0.001), but there was also a direct association between race and these outcomes (LOS 3 days or more: -0.088 [95% CI -0.13 to -0.049]; p < 0.001; nonhome discharge: 0.046 [95% CI 0.014 to 0.078]; p = 0.006). ADI did not mediate the associations observed between race and 90-day readmission and ED admission in the TKA group.ConclusionOur findings suggest that socioeconomic disadvantage may be implicated in a substantial proportion of the previously assumed race-driven disparity in healthcare utilization parameters after primary total joint arthroplasty. Orthopaedic surgeons should attempt to identify potentially modifiable socioeconomic disadvantage indicators. This serves as a call to action for the orthopaedic community to consider specific interventions to support patients from vulnerable areas or whose incomes are lower, such as supporting applications for nonemergent medical transportation or referring patients to local care coordination agencies. Future studies should seek to identify which specific resources or approaches improve outcomes after TJA in patients with socioeconomic disadvantage.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study. © 2022.

However, despite the increasing incidence of ACL injury in young patients and a substantial proportion of families who may prefer languages other than English, the relationship between language and clinical care remains unclear.Questions/purposesTo investigate the relationship between language and the care of children and adolescents with ACL tears, we asked: (1) Is a preferred language other than English (PLOE) associated with a delay between ACL injury and surgery? (2) Is a PLOE associated with a greater odds of a patient experiencing a meniscal tear and undergoing a meniscectomy than in those who prefer English?MethodsWe treated 591 patients surgically for ACL injuries between 2011 and 2021. Of those, we considered patients aged 18 years or younger who underwent primary ACL reconstruction for this retrospective, comparative study. Five percent (31 of 591) of patients were excluded because the date of injury was not clearly documented, 2% (11 of 591) were revision reconstructions, and 1% (6 of 591) underwent procedures that were intentionally delayed or staged, leaving 92% (543 of 591) for analysis. The mean age was 16 ± 2 years, and 51% (276 of 543) of patients were boys. The family's preferred language was noted, as were demographic data, time between injury and surgery, and intraoperative findings. A language other than English was preferred by 21% (113 of 543) of patients. Of these, 94% (106 of 113) preferred Spanish. In a univariate analysis, we used independent-samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Purposeful-entry multivariable regression analyses were used to determine whether PLOE was associated with increased time to surgery, concomitant meniscus injury, or performance of meniscectomy while adjusting for confounding variables. Variables were included in multivariable models if they met the threshold for statistical significance in univariate testing (p < 0.05).ResultsThe median time between injury and ACL reconstruction was shorter in families who preferred English compared with those with a PLOE (69 days [IQR 80] versus 103 days [IQR 107)]; p < 0.001). After controlling for potentially confounding variables like insurance and age, we found that patients whose families had a PLOE had greater odds of undergoing surgery more than 60 days after injury (OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.3 to 3.8]; p = 0.005) and more than 90 days after injury (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.1 to 2.8]; p = 0.02). After controlling for insurance, age, and other factors, PLOE was not associated with surgical delay beyond 180 days, concomitant meniscal tears, or performance of meniscectomy.ConclusionIn this study of children and adolescents undergoing primary ACL reconstruction, patients whose families prefer a language other than English experienced a longer delay between injury and surgery. In areas with a large proportion of families with a PLOE, partnerships with primary care clinicians, emergency departments, schools, athletic teams, and community organizations may improve efficiency in the care of children with ACL injuries. Clinicians proficient in other languages, reliable interpreter services, and translated references and resources may also be impactful. Our results suggest a need for further research on the experiences, needs, and long-term outcomes of these patients, as well as the association of preferred language with results after surgery.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Despite persistent federal efforts to study and address the health information technology needs of patients, there is limited information regarding the current high-speed internet landscape as it relates to access to orthopaedic surgical care.Questions/purposes(1) What is the distribution of practicing orthopaedic surgeons in the United States relative to the presence of broadband internet access? (2) What geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic factors are associated with the absence of high-speed internet and access to a local orthopaedic surgeon?MethodsThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Mapping Broadband in America interactive tool was used to determine the proportion of county residents with access to broadband-speed internet for all 3141 US counties. Data regarding the geographic distribution of orthopaedic surgeons and county-level characteristics were obtained from the 2015 Physician Compare National Downloadable File and the Area Health Resource File, respectively. The FCC mapping broadband public use files are considered the most comprehensive datasets describing high-speed internet infrastructure within the United States. The year 2015 represents the most recently available FCC data for which county-level broadband penetration estimates are available. Third-party audits of the FCC data have shown that broadband expansion has been slow over the past decade and that many large improvements have been driven by changes in the reporting methodology. Therefore, we believe the 2015 FCC data still hold relevance. The primary outcome measure was the simultaneous absence of at least 50% broadband penetration and at least one orthopaedic surgeon practicing in county limits. Statistical analyses using Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable logistic regression were conducted to assess for factors associated with inaccessibility to orthopaedic telehealth. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance threshold of p < 0.05.ResultsIn 2015, 14% (448 of 3141) of counties were considered ""low access"" in that they both had no orthopaedic surgeons and possessed less than 50% broadband access. A total of 4,660,559 people lived within these low-access counties, representing approximately 1.4% (4.6 million of 320.7 million) of the US population. After controlling for potential confounding variables, such as the age, sex, income level, and educational attainment, lower population density per square mile (OR 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 0.94]; p < 0.01), a lower number of primary care physicians per 100,000 (OR 0.88 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.97]; p < 0.01), a higher unemployment level (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.2 to 1.4]; p < 0.01), and greater number preventable hospital stays per 100,000 (OR 1.01 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.02]; p < 0.01) were associated with increased odds of being a low-access county (though the effect size of the finding was small for population density and number of primary care physicians). Stated another way, each additional person per square mile was associated with an 8% (95% CI 6% to 10%; p < 0.01) decrease in the odds of being a low-access county, and each additional percentage point of unemployment was associated with a 30% (95% CI 20% to 40%) increase in the odds of being a low-access county.ConclusionDespite the potential for telehealth programs to improve the delivery of high-quality orthopaedic surgical care, broadband internet access remains a major barrier to implementation. Until targeted investments are made to expand broadband infrastructure across the country, health systems, policymakers, and surgeon leaders must capitalize on existing federal subsidy programs, such as the lifeline or affordability connectivity initiatives, to reach unemployed patients living in economically depressed regions. The incorporation of internet access questions into clinic-based social determinants screening may facilitate the development of alternative follow-up protocols for patients unable to participate in synchronous videoconferencing.Clinical RelevanceSome orthopaedic patients lack the broadband capacity necessary for telehealth visits, in which case surgeons may pursue alternative methods of follow-up such as mobile phone-based surveillance of postoperative wounds, surgical sites, and clinical symptoms. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, surgery is still sometimes considered for some patients, and it is likely that a few patients would benefit from tumor removal if the likelihood of local recurrence could be predicted. However, to our knowledge, there is no tool that can provide guidance on this for clinicians at the point of care.Question/purposeWe sought to explore whether a combined molecular and clinical prognostic model for relapse in patients with desmoid tumors treated with surgery would allow us to identify patients who might do well with surgical excision.MethodsThis was a retrospective, single-center study of 107 patients with desmoid tumors who were surgically treated between January 1980 and December 2015, with a median follow-up of 106 months (range 7 to 337 months). We correlated clinical variables (age, tumor size, and localization) and CTNNB1 gene mutations with recurrence-free survival. Recurrence-free survival was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Univariate and multivariable analyses of time to local recurrence were performed using Cox regression models. A final nomogram model was constructed according to the final fitted Cox model. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using measures of calibration and discrimination: calibration plot and the Harrell C-statistic, also known as the concordance index, in which values near 0.5 represent a random prediction and values near 1 represent the best model predictions.ResultsThe multivariable analysis showed that S45F mutations (hazard ratio 5.25 [95% confidence interval 2.27 to 12.15]; p < 0.001) and tumor in the extremities (HR 3.15 [95% CI 1.35 to 7.33]; p = 0.008) were associated with a higher risk of local recurrence. Based on these risk factors, we created a model; we observed that patients considered to be at high risk of local recurrence as defined by having one or two factors associated with recurrence (extremity tumors and S45F mutation) had an HR of 8.4 compared with patients who had no such factors (95% CI 2.84 to 24.6; p < 0.001). From these data and based on the multivariable Cox models, we also developed a nomogram to estimate the individual risk of relapse after surgical resection. The model had a concordance index of 0.75, or moderate discrimination.ConclusionCTNNB1 S45F mutations combined with other clinical variables are a potential prognostic biomarker associated with the risk of relapse in patients with desmoid tumors. The developed nomogram is simple to use and, if validated, could be incorporated into clinical practice to identify patients at high risk of relapse among patients opting for surgical excision and thus help clinicians and patients in decision-making. A large multicenter study is necessary to validate our model and explore its applicability.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study. © 2023 Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research.

Even though infection and tumor recurrence are established risk factors for early amputation (< 5 years) after LSS, the frequency of and factors associated with late amputation (≥ 5 years from diagnosis) in children with sarcomas are not known. Additionally, the resulting psychosocial and physical outcomes of these patients compared with those treated with primary amputation or LSS that was not complicated by subsequent amputation are not well studied. Studying these outcomes is critical to enhancing the quality of life of patients with sarcomas.Questions/purposes(1) How have treatments changed over time in patients with lower extremity sarcoma who are included in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), and did primary treatment with amputation or LSS affect overall survival at 25 years among patients who had survived at least 5 years from diagnosis? (2) What is the cumulative incidence of amputation after LSS for patients diagnosed with pediatric lower extremity sarcomas 25 years after diagnosis? (3) What are the factors associated with time to late amputation (≥ 5 years after diagnosis) in patients initially treated with LSS for lower extremity sarcomas in the CCSS? (4) What are the comparative social, physical, and emotional health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes among patients with sarcoma treated with primary amputation, LSS without amputation, or LSS complicated by late amputation, as assessed by CCSS follow-up questionnaires, the SF-36, and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 at 20 years after cancer diagnosis?MethodsThe CCSS is a long-term follow-up study that began in 1994 and is coordinated through St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It is a retrospective study with longitudinal follow-up of more than 38,000 participants treated for childhood cancer when younger than 21 years at one of 31 collaborating institutions between 1970 and 1999 in the United States and Canada. Participants were eligible for enrollment in the CCSS after they had survived 5 years from diagnosis. Within the CCSS cohort, we included participants who had a diagnosis of lower extremity sarcoma treated with primary amputation (547 patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 13 ± 4 years) or primary LSS (510 patients with a mean age 14 ± 4 years). The LSS cohort was subdivided into LSS without amputation, defined as primary LSS without amputation at the time of latest follow-up; LSS with early amputation, defined as LSS complicated by amputation occurring less than 5 years from diagnosis; or LSS with late amputation, defined as primary LSS in study patients who subsequently underwent amputation 5 years or more from cancer diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of late amputation after primary LSS was estimated. Cox proportional hazards regression with time-varying covariates identified factors associated with late amputation. Modified Poisson regression models were used to compare psychosocial, physical, and HRQOL outcomes among patients treated with primary amputation, LSS without amputation, or LSS complicated by late amputation using validated surveys.ResultsMore study participants were treated with LSS than with primary amputation in more recent decades. The overall survival at 25 years in this population who survived 5 years from diagnosis was not different between those treated with primary amputation (87% [95% confidence interval [CI] 82% to 91%]) compared with LSS (88% [95% CI 85% to 91%]; p = 0.31). The cumulative incidence of amputation at 25 years after cancer diagnosis and primary LSS was 18% (95% CI 14% to 21%). With the numbers available, the cumulative incidence of late amputation was not different among study patients treated in the 1970s (27% [95% CI 15% to 38%]) versus the 1980s and 1990s (19% [95% CI 13% to 25%] and 15% [95% CI 10% to 19%], respectively; p = 0.15). After controlling for gender, medical and surgical treatment variables, cancer recurrence, and chronic health conditions, gender (hazard ratio [HR] 2.02 [95% CI 1.07 to 3.82]; p = 0.03) and history of prosthetic joint reconstruction (HR 2.58 [95% CI 1.37 to 4.84]; p = 0.003) were associated with an increased likelihood of late amputation. Study patients treated with a primary amputation (relative risk [RR] 2.04 [95% CI 1.15 to 3.64]) and LSS complicated by late amputation (relative risk [RR] 3.85 [95% CI 1.66 to 8.92]) were more likely to be unemployed or unable to attend school than patients treated with LSS without amputation to date. The CCSS cohort treated with primary amputation and those with LSS complicated by late amputation reported worse physical health scores than those without amputation to date, although mental and emotional health outcomes did not differ between the groups.ConclusionThere is a substantial risk of late amputation after LSS, and both primary and late amputation status are associated with decreased physical HRQOL outcomes. Children treated for sarcoma who survive into adulthood after primary amputation and those who undergo late amputation after LSS may benefit from interventions focused on improving physical function and reaching educational and employment milestones. Efforts to improve the physical function of people who have undergone amputation either through prosthetic design or integration into the residuum should be supported. Understanding factors associated with late amputation in the setting of more modern surgical approaches and implants will help surgeons more effectively manage patient expectations and adjust practice to mitigate these risks over the life of the patient.Level of EvidenceLevel III, therapeutic study. © 2023 Authors.

The FMS2 assessment tool has recently been developed as a targeted solution to many of the existing barriers preventing practitioners from utilising MC assessments. The aim of this study was to investigate the structural and convergent validity of this new tool among 8- to 12-year-old Irish primary school children. As part of this study, 102 children (56.8% female, mean = 9.8 years) were assessed using the FMS2, the Test of Gross Motor Development (3rd edition) (TGMD-3) (short version) and the Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS™). Structural validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The convergent validity between the FMS2, the TGMD-3 (short version) and the FMS™ was investigated using the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient. Results of CFA for the FMS2 indicate a good fit model, supporting a three-factor structure (locomotor, object manipulation, and stability). Additional findings indicate a moderate, positive correlation between the FMS2 and the TGMD-3 (short version) (r = 0.66), with a low, positive correlation between the FMS2 and the FMS™ (r = 0.48). This study presents the first preliminary findings to suggest that the FMS2 may be a versatile, time-efficient, and ecologically valid tool to measure children's MC in multiple settings (e.g. research, education, sport, athletic therapy, and physiotherapy). Future research should also seek to continue to implement this solution, consolidate the existing validity findings with a larger and more diverse sample, and further explore the feasibility of the tool in ‘real-world’ settings. © The Author(s) 2023.",Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176375692,1060,0,,

Since attitudes impact decisions to be physically active, identifying how PA attitudes relate to established attitudes toward physical education (PE), as well as PA intentions and behaviors are important—and thus the focus of this study. Middle school students (N = 948; 45% female) completed PA behavior, PA intention, and PA and PE attitude surveys. Findings provided a better understanding of attitude theory with the identification of relationships between PA attitudes and PE attitudes, behavioral intention, and behavior. Multiple regression model results showed significant relationships between positive PA attitudes, negative PA attitudes, and PE attitudes with behavioral intention, and self-reported PA behavior. Differences between positive and negative PA attitudes were identified with positive PA attitudes most predicting intention.

To overcome this research gap, this study examines voluntary referees’ general job satisfaction and several job satisfaction facets, their efforts and rewards based on the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model and how this ERI relates to their job satisfaction. Research methods: The study’s sample consists of n = 3075 voluntary football referees in Germany having completed the online survey. Logistic regression analyses, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to answer the research questions. Results and Findings: The four job satisfaction facets esteem, colleagues, promotion prospects and expense allowance all significantly predict the voluntary referees’ general job satisfaction accounting for more than one-third of its variance. While esteem shows the highest practical relevance in determining job satisfaction, promotion prospects and expense allowance have the lowest influence. Although voluntary referees predominantly do not indicate an ERI, it is significantly associated with job dissatisfaction. Implications: This study enriches theory considering general and facet-specific job satisfaction in combination with the ERI model. Practically, to create a satisfying refereeing environment, associations should particularly ensure that referees feel appreciated for their voluntary activity and foster the social interaction among referee colleagues strengthening their camaraderie. Furthermore, associations can attempt to reduce efforts or increase rewards to prevent referees’ job dissatisfaction. © 2021 The Author(s).

Drawing from dual-process decision-making models, the purpose of this study was to examine how rational and affective motivational mechanisms influence youths’ intention and participatory behavior after watching an elite sport event. Research methods: Data were collected from 318 youth post-spectating an elite track cycling event. Post-event questionnaires measured rational and affective motivational antecedents of intention, while the behavior was measured through sport program participation within one year following the event. Results and findings: Structural equation modeling revealed that rational (i.e. attitude toward the behavior, perceived behavioral control, descriptive norm) and affective (i.e. inspiration) motivational mechanisms significantly predicted intention, and intention, was a small but statistically significant predictor of participation. Implications: Scholars should consider the integration of both rational (e.g. participation constraints) and affective-based (e.g. inspiration) motivational mechanisms when modeling sport participation behaviors. Practitioners should consider designing event leveraging strategies that expand youth’s social networks (e.g. youth activities during event intermissions) and create experiential conditions which induce a state of inspiration (e.g. having athletes speak to youth after the event). © 2021 European Association for Sport Management.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106298326,1083,0,,

The extent to which sport responds to climate change (e.g. minimizing carbon emissions, adapting to climate impacts) will become more dire. Thus, it is crucial for sport to respond now to address current and emerging sustainability challenges. The popularity of sport can create opportunities to promote and influence individual behaviour change and drive organizational efforts to be environmentally sustainable. Research Methods: The sport management academy is currently limited in its efforts to highlight, examine, and educate industry and students on the issues raised due to changes in the natural environment and the impact on the sport sector. The five articles included in this special issue aim to begin to bridge this gap. Results and Findings: Sport is not inherently sustainable or unsustainable. We introduce this special issue to provide an overview of the current and future environmental challenges in sport management.

Trademark squatting of transliterated names belonging to well-known celebrities and athletes is perceived by the international business community to be a serious problem in China. Translations are words that have been converted from alphabetic languages into words in character-based languages. As such, the purpose of this study was to examine the phenomena of trademark squatting of foreign athletes’ names and whether that phenomena poses a significant threat to foreign athletes due to the appropriation and bad-faith registration of their transliterated names. Methods: A qualitative research approach was employed to detect indicators for both (a) trademark squatting and (b) good faith registrations, which were then applied to trademark registrations for names that matched the transliterations for well-known NBA athletes and the business records for those who registered the marks. Results and Findings: 210 registrations (38%) of transliterated names belonging to 55 (57%) of the 96 NBA players included in the study were deemed to include strong indicators of trademark squatting. Implications: The prevalence of trademark squatting in China involving the transliterated names of foreign athletes warrants proactive measures by athletes and those who protect and manage their brands. Athletes who compete in contests that are broadcast within China run the risk of losing the rights to their transliterated names to squatters if transliterations are not developed and registered by the athlete. © 2021 European Association for Sport Management.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104349766,1078,0,,

Broadcasters’ match selections and TV ratings were regressed on antecedent factors of the demand for televised CSL matches. Results and findings: The broadcaster selection model showed broadcasters’ preferences for higher outcome uncertainty, higher athlete salaries, higher league standings, and teams contending for the CSL Championship. The viewership model indicated higher TV ratings for matches with larger fan bases, higher athlete salaries, higher-ranked teams, and those held on weekends or at night. Implications: This study expands football media demand research and is one of the few to explore match selection and viewership factors in CSL. It offers practical insights for sport broadcasters and league managers in Asian and global contexts. © 2023 The Author(s).

Methods: Twenty-four rugby league players competing in the British University and Colleges Sport Premier North Division were randomized to VRCT (n = 8), TCT (n = 8), or control (CON; n = 8). Experimental groups completed a 6-week lower-body complex training intervention (2×/wk) that involved alternating high-load resistance exercise with plyometric exercise within the same session. The VRCT group performed resistance exercises at 70% of 1-repetition maximum (1RM) + 0% to 23% of 1RM from band resistance with a 90-second intracontrast rest interval, whereas the TCT group performed resistance exercise at 93% of 1RM with a 4-minute intracontrast rest interval. Back-squat 1RM, countermovement jump peak power, reactive strength index, sprint times, and Kleg were assessed pretraining and posttraining. Results: VRCT and TCT significantly improved 1RM back squat, countermovement jump peak power, and 5-m sprint time (all P < .05). VRCT also improved Kleg, whereas TCT improved 10- and 20-m sprint times (all P < .05). Between groups, both VRCT and TCT improved 1RM back squat compared with CON (both P < .001). Additionally, VRCT improved Kleg compared with CON (right leg: P = .016) and TCT improved 20-m sprint time compared with CON (P = .042). Conclusions: VRCT and TCT can be implemented during the competitive season to improve strength, power, and 5-m sprint time. VRCT may lead to greater improvements in reactive strength index and Kleg, whereas TCT may enhance 10- and 20-m sprint times. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149177949,1285,0,,"SPSS, Excel"

This study evaluated potential performance-enhancing effects of stroboscopic eyewear applied during warm-up on reaction speed that may provide athletes an edge in visuomotor-demanding sports. Methods: Twenty-eight international-level table tennis athletes participated in this study. Participants performed their individual 10-minute table-tennis-specific warm-up under normal visual conditions and with stroboscopic eyewear. Prior to and after the warm-up, visuomotor reaction time was assessed in a sport-specific reaction test where athletes had to return 30 table tennis balls played by a ball machine at high speed to their backhand side. Reaction time was determined as the interval between ball output and movement onset as triggered by a mechanical switch. Furthermore, the time between ball–table contact and ball–racket contact (hit time) was analyzed as an indicator of how early the athletes intercepted the ball. Results: Reaction time significantly improved following the warm-up (P < .001, η2p = .393). However, there was no additional benefit of the stroboscopic eyewear (P = .338, η2p = .034). No changes after the warm-up were observed for hit time (P = .246, η2p = .055). Conclusions: The results indicate that warm-up facilitated visuomotor reaction speed; however, stroboscopic eyewear did not provide additional positive effects when compared to a warm-up under normal visual conditions. While shutter glasses may be useful for training over longer periods, short-term positive effects were not supported in this study. © 2023 Human Kinetics Publishers Inc..

Methods: A total of 108 soccer athletes were assessed, followed up for 3 months, and evaluated for a history of adductor injury 6 months before BAPT evaluation. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used as the normality test. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare BAPT scores between injured and uninjured athletes. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify the athletes’ chances of injury based on their BAPT scores. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the cutoff point for the number of repetitions in the BAPT and Spearman bivariate correlation and identify factors potentially related to the test score. Furthermore, the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine interexaminer agreement. The level of significance was set at 95%. Results: The BAPT scores for hip adductor injury history did not differ significantly (P = .08). A significant deficit was identified in the BAPT scores of the injured athletes at the 3-month follow-up (P = .001). The cutoff point identified was 33 repetitions. Low BAPT scores increased the chance of injury by 20% (odds ratio, 1.20%; P = .001). The interexaminer agreement was .96 (P = .001). Conclusion: BAPT can be used to identify athletes most likely to sustain hip adductor muscle injuries, indirectly reducing the rate of this injury in soccer clubs. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160966195,1254,0,,SPSS

Additionally, video stimulus has been associated with enhanced kinesthetic sensations and rapid hormone fluctuations that may contribute to enhancing mental rehearsal and the conscious and unconscious emotional state for skill execution. Here, we assessed the impact of a 15-minute mental rehearsal intervention on rugby-specific tasks and the associated hormone profile. Methods: Professional rugby players (N = 10) volunteered for a randomized crossover study. They completed three 15-minute preparatory phases (positive or negative video-guided mental rehearsal or self-directed mental rehearsal alone) prior to an exercise stressor and rugby-specific passing task. Salivary testosterone and cortisol were monitored to assess stress responses. Results: Performance during the rugby passing task was improved following the positive video condition (91% [7.4%]) compared to the negative video (79% [6.0%]; ES: 1.22 ± 0.75) and self-visualization (86% [5.8%]; ES: 0.58 ± 0.75), with a significant correlation observed between passing performance and salivary testosterone (r = .47 ± .34, P = .0087). Positive video imagery prior to an exercise stressor also significantly enhanced physiological stress resilience (r = .39 ± .36, P = .0352). Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates that mental rehearsal was enhanced by appropriate, context-specific video presentation. We propose that the interaction between sex steroids, the adrenal axis, and subsequent conscious and unconscious behaviors may be relevant to competitive rugby. Specifically, we suggest that relatively elevated free testosterone imparts a degree of stress resilience, which may lead to enhanced expression of competitive behaviors and provide an enhanced state for rugby skill execution.  © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168799617,1187,0,,

Methods: Details of 396 flights from national-team players (N = 68) were obtained and verified via an online flight database. Each player provided ratings of perceptual fatigue, sleep, soreness, stress, and jet lag for 2 days before and after each trip. The flight path (continents of departure and arrival), travel context (into vs out of national team), and arrival and departure times were obtained for each trip. Linear mixed models compared the pretravel with posttravel change in perceptual responses based on flight path, context, and schedule. Results: Perceived jet-lag ratings were more responsive to travel variables (R2 = .48) than other perceptual ratings (R2 < .26). Travel from Asia to Europe (P < .05) and Europe to Australia (P < .001) had significantly higher jet-lag ratings than all other paths. Fatigue scores were worst following Asia to Europe (P < .05) and Europe to Australia (P < .05) travel, while sleep scores were worst following Europe to Australia travel (P < .01). Perceptual responses were poorer following travel from national team to club compared with all other travel contexts (P < .05). Arrival during the daytime (11 AM to 5 PM) resulted in better perceptual responses than early-morning or late-night arrivals (P < .05). Conclusions: Perceived jet-lag ratings are more responsive to travel demands than perceptual wellness scales in national-team football athletes. Poorer perceptual responses may be expected when travel is longer in nature, ends later in the day, or involves travel out of the national team back to club. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172034219,1213,0,,R

Methods: Elite male racewalkers completed 3 weeks of periodic training while adhering to their dietary intervention. Twenty-nine data sets were collected from 21 athletes. Each week, 6 mandatory training sessions were completed, with additional sessions performed at the athlete’s discretion. Mandatory sessions included an interval session (10 × 1-km efforts on a 6-min cycle), tempo session (14 km with a 450-m elevation gain), 2 long walks (25–40 km), and 2 easy walks (8–12 km) where “sleep-low” and “train-low” dietary strategies were employed for PCHO. Racewalking speed, heart rate, rating of perceived exhaustion, and blood metabolites were collected around key sessions. Results: LCHF covered less total distance than HCHO and PCHO (P < .001); however, no differences in training load between groups were evident (P = .285). During the interval sessions, walking speed was slower in LCHF (P = .001), equating to a 2.8% and 5.6% faster speed in HCHO and PCHO, respectively. LCHF was also 3.2% slower in completing the tempo session than HCHO and PCHO (P = .001). Heart rate was higher (P = .002) and lactate concentrations were lower (P < .001) in LCHF compared to other groups, despite slower walking speeds during the interval session. No between-groups differences in rating of perceived exhaustion were evident (P = .077). Conclusion: Athletes adhering to an LCHF diet showed impaired training capacity relative to their high-CHO-supported counterparts, completing lower training volumes at slower speeds, with higher heart rates. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164047179,1194,0,,R

Methods: Forty male basketball players (21.8 [3.8] y), from 4 teams that competed in regional and national championships, were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: (1) vertical jump group, (2) horizontal jump group, (3) vertical and horizontal jump group, and (4) control group. The subjects followed a plyometric training program twice a week for 6 weeks, differing in the execution direction of the jumps. All groups performed the same total training volume of acyclic and cyclic jumps controlled through the number of contacts per session. Pretraining and posttraining measurements included (1) rocket jump, (2) Abalakov jump, (3) horizontal jump, (4) 20-m linear sprint, and (5) V-Cut change-of-direction test. Results: The vertical and horizontal jump group showed significant increases in all performance variables examined, except for linear sprint performance, in which no group improved. The vertical jump group showed significant improvements in rocket jump and Abalakov jump (P < .01), but worsened significantly in terms of sprint performance (P < .05). The horizontal jump group showed significant increases in rocket jump and horizontal jump (P < .001–.01). Furthermore, all experimental groups showed improved V-Cut change-of-direction test performance. Conclusions: These results indicate that combining vertical and horizontal jumps induces improvements in more capabilities than does training only vertical or horizontal jumps with the same training volume. Training only vertical or horizontal jumps will improve performance mainly in vertically or horizontally oriented tasks, respectively. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149618934,1283,0,,"SPSS, Excel"

PURPOSE: This commentary aims to provide insight into the expected implications of the reduction in course length heading into the 2028 Games, focusing on the training and monitoring of high-performance rowers, as well as tactical, technical, and pacing considerations for performance. The reduction in event duration (estimated to be ∼90-120 s across all event classes) will lead to an expected ∼5% to 15% increase in relative contribution of anaerobic metabolism. Consequently, adjustment in training periodization priorities toward higher-intensity interventions may be required, especially in the period immediately prior to the games. The critical-power and anaerobic-power-reserve concepts may become more useful tools for structuring exercise programs, evaluating training outcomes, and determining event suitability through individual physiological profiling. Additionally, the adoption of a more constant (flat) pacing strategy, rather than the commonly used reverse J-shaped approach, might be considered for racing over this new distance. Finally, technical aspects, such as stroke rate and gearing, may require adjustment for optimal performance; however, research is clearly required to explore such effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our intention is to stimulate discussion and debate, with the provision of practical recommendations that aim to optimize rowers' preparation for and performance at the 2028 Olympic Games.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145242190,1348,0,,

Objective: To determine whether PA increases were responsible for the improvements in mental health and QOL among adolescents who returned to sport during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Wisconsin secondary schools. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 559 adolescent athletes (age = 15.7 + 1.2 years, females = 43.6%) from 44 schools completed a survey in October 2020. Main Outcome Measure(s): Demographic information, whether they had returned to sport participation, school instruction type, anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), QOL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0), and PA (Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale). Mediation analysis was used to assess whether the relationships between sport status and anxiety, depression, and QOL were mediated by PA. Results: At the time of the study, 171 (31%) had returned to play and 388 (69%) had not. Athletes who had returned to play had less anxiety (3.6 ± 0.4 versus 8.2 ± 0.6, P <.001) and depression (4.2 ± 0.4 versus 7.3 ± 0.6, P <.001) and higher QOL (88.1 ± 1.0 versus 80.2 ± 1.4, P <.001) and more PA (24.0 ± 0.5 versus 16.3 ± 0.7, P <.001). Physical activity explained a significant, but small, proportion of the difference in depression (22.1%, P = .02) and QOL (16.0%, P = .048) but not anxiety (6.6%, P = .20) between athletes who had and those who had not returned to play. Conclusions: Increased PA was responsible for only a small portion of the improvements in depression and QOL among athletes who returned to sports. This suggests that most of the mental health benefits of sport participation for adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic were independent of the benefits of increased PA. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

One of the most common mental health concerns for student-athletes is feeling overwhelmed or anxious. Early recognition of these symptoms can help student-athletes find early intervention. Objective: To elucidate specific attributes associated with an increased likelihood of anxiety symptoms and treatment avoidance to help athletic trainers and other practitioners better identify and assist high-risk individuals. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Colleges and universities in the United States. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 51 882 varsity athletes who completed the National College Health Assessment between 2011 and 2019. Main Outcome Measure(s): Survey responses (self-report) to questions related to anxiety symptoms and disorders crosssectioned into 9 predictors: year in school, gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, international student status, school type, received information on stress reduction or depression or anxiety, anxiety about impeding academic performance, and history of mental health treatment in the last year. Results: More than three-fourths (82.9%, n = 43 016) of student-athletes reported feeling overwhelmed because of all that they had to do in their daily activities, whereas only half (47.5%, n = 24 645) of student-athletes described overwhelming anxiety as a symptom. Gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, school type, and previous mental health treatment had large effects on these 2 symptoms. However, of the studentathletes who reported overwhelming anxiety as a symptom, only one-fourth (22.9%, n = 5649) indicated they received a diagnosis of anxiety with or without treatment. Conclusions: Factors such as the year in school and availability of mental health information appeared to have little effect on the experience of anxiety-related symptoms and the propensity to seek treatment. However, other factors, including gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, school type, and previous mental health treatment, did have important effects. Our study provides additional evidence that the stresses placed on collegiate student-athletes frequently led to feelings of being overwhelmed and, eventually, anxiety disorder diagnoses. However, most student-athletes experiencing anxiety-related symptoms still did not seek a diagnosis with or without treatment. © 2023 National Athletic Trainers' Association Inc..

Ongoing efforts to better educate and equip athletic trainers to help student-athletes in this regard should result in improved mental health—related outcomes. Objective: To examine changes in the mental health of student-athletes over the past decade compared with that of nonathlete students. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Colleges and universities in the United States. Patients or Other Participants: Varsity athletes (athletes; n ¼ 54479) and nonathlete students (nonathletes; n ¼ 448301) who completed the National College Health Assessment between 2011 and 2019. Main Outcome Measure(s): Surveys included responses (self-reported) to questions in 5 mental health—related categories: recent mental health symptoms, recent mental health diagnosis, mental health treatment-seeking behavior, receiving mental health information from the institution, and the recent effect of mental health factors on academic performance. Results: Athletes consistently described lower symptom and diagnosis rates compared with nonathletes, except for attempted suicide, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Rates of diagnosis increased over time in both groups but remained lower in athletes. Treatment-seeking behavior and openness to future treatment increased over time in both groups but remained lower in athletes. Athletes received more information on stress reduction, substance abuse, eating disorders, and handling distress or violence compared with nonathletes. Both groups received information more frequently over time. Athletes reported fewer academic effects, especially for depression and anxiety, but these effects grew over time in both groups. The effects of injuries and extracurricular activities on academic performance were greater in athletes than in nonathletes. Conclusions: Athletes described overall lower levels of mental health symptoms, diagnoses, and academic effects compared with nonathletes. Whereas the rates in nonathletes climbed over the past decade, the rates in athletes broadly remained flat or climbed less rapidly. Increasingly positive attitudes toward treatment were encouraging, but the deficit in athletes relative to nonathletes persisted.

Common impairments associated with CAI may play a role in cartilage behavior in response to mechanical loading. Objective: To identify mechanical and sensorimotor outcomes that are linked with the magnitude of talar cartilage deformation after a static loading protocol in patients with and those without CAI. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Laboratory setting. Patients or Other Participants: Thirty individuals with CAI and 30 healthy individuals. Main Outcome Measures(s): After a 60-minute off-loading period, ultrasonographic images of the talar cartilage were acquired immediately before and after a 2-minute static loading protocol (single-legged stance). Talar cartilage images were obtained and manually segmented to enable calculation of medial, lateral, and overall average talar thickness. The percentage change, relative to the average baseline thickness, was used for further analysis. Mechanical (ankle joint laxity) and sensorimotor (static balance and Star Excursion Balance Test) outcomes were captured. Partial correlations were computed to determine associations between cartilage deformation magnitude and the mechanical and sensorimotor outcomes after accounting for body weight. Results: In the CAI group, greater inversion laxity was associated with greater overall (r =-0.42, P = .03) and medial (r = -0.48, P = .01) talar cartilage deformation after a 2-minute static loading protocol. Similarly, poorer medial-lateral static balance was linked with greater overall (r = 0.47, P = .01) and lateral (r = 0.50, P = .01) talar cartilage deformation. In the control group, shorter posterolateral Star Excursion Balance Test reach distance was associated with greater lateral cartilage deformation (r = 0.42, P = .03). No other significant associations were observed. Conclusions: In those with CAI, inversion laxity and poor static postural control were moderately associated with greater talar cartilage deformation after a 2-minute static loading protocol. These results suggest that targeting mechanical instability and poor balance in those with CAI via intervention strategies may improve how the talar cartilage responds to static loading conditions. © the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc www.natajournals.org.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151573878,1384,0,,SPSS

Of these patients, 39 with a minimum follow-up of 5 years had complete radiographic and pulmonary function test results and were included. The Cobb angle of the major curve, T1-S1 height, T1-T12 height, and maximum kyphosis angle in the sagittal plane were measured on radiographs. Pulmonary function test results were collected in all patients before the initial operation (preoperatively), 12 months after the initial operation (postoperatively), and at the last follow-up. The changes in pulmonary function and complications during treatment were analyzed.Results:The mean age of patients before the initial operation was 7.7 ± 1.2 years, and the mean follow-up period was 75.0 ± 14.1 months. The mean number of lengthenings was 4.5 ± 1.3, and the mean interval between lengthenings was 11.2 ± 2.1 months. The Cobb angle improved from 104.5° ± 18.2° preoperatively to 38.1° ± 10.1° after the initial surgical procedure (postoperatively) and 21.9° ± 8.6° at the final follow-up. The T1-S1 height increased from 25.1 ± 4.0 cm preoperatively to 32.4 ± 3.5 cm postoperatively and to 39.5 ± 4.0 cm at the final follow-up. However, no significant difference was detected between the increased pulmonary function parameters at 1 year and those before the operation (p > 0.05), except for residual volume, whereas pulmonary function parameters had significantly increased at the final follow-up (p < 0.05). During the treatment period, 17 complications occurred in 12 patients.Conclusions:DGRs are effective in treating sEOS in the long term. They allow longitudinal growth of the spine, and the correction of the spinal deformity can provide conditions that make improving pulmonary function possible in patients with sEOS.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level IV.

However, the clinical and surgical characteristics of AAD in patients with sandwich fusion have not been clearly defined. Methods: A retrospective case-control study with a large sample size and a minimum 2-year follow-up was performed. From 2000 to 2018, 253 patients with sandwich AAD underwent a surgical procedure; these patients constituted the case group, and a matching number of patients with non-sandwich AAD were randomly selected to form the control group. Clinical data from electronic medical records and various imaging studies were analyzed and compared. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale was used to evaluate neurological function. Results: Patients with sandwich AAD, compared with patients with non-sandwich AAD, had symptom onset at a younger age (34.8 compared with 42.8 years; p < 0.001) and had a higher likelihood for myelopathy (87.4% compared with 74.7%; p < 0.001). Patients with sandwich AAD had a higher incidence of lower cranial nerve palsy (7.9% compared with 0.0%; p < 0.001), a lower preoperative JOA score (13.4 compared with 14.2; p < 0.001), and higher incidences of accompanying Type-I Chiari malformation (20.9% compared with 1.2%; p < 0.001) and syringomyelia (21.3% compared with 1.6%; p < 0.001). Finally, patients with sandwich AAD had higher likelihoods of undergoing transoral release (28.5% compared with 5.1%; p < 0.001) and use of salvage fixation techniques (34.4% compared with 6.3%; p < 0.001), and had lower postoperative results for the JOA score (14.9 compared with 15.9; p < 0.001) and improvement rate (43.8% compared with 58.2%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with sandwich AAD demonstrated distinct clinical manifestations. Versatility involving the use of various internal fixation techniques and transoral release procedures was frequently required in the surgical management of these patients, and meticulous and personalized preoperative planning would be of paramount importance.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate (1) whether a torn DLM is associated with more varus alignment than a torn semilunar lateral meniscus (SLM) and (2) whether the lower-limb alignment associated with a torn DLM changes with age. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery for a torn lateral meniscus were included. Patients with a torn DLM (confirmed on arthroscopy) were allocated to the DLM group; those with a torn SLM were allocated to the SLM group. After strict screening according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 436 and 423 patients were included in the DLM and SLM groups, respectively. The mechanical axis deviation (MAD), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle, and medial proximal tibial angle were compared between the 2 groups after propensity score matching. Additionally, the correlation of the HKA and MAD with age was evaluated within the DLM group. Results: After propensity score matching, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 groups. The DLM group had significantly more varus alignment than the SLM group (MAD: 3.6 mm ± 9.6 mm versus 1.1 mm ± 10.3 mm, respectively, p = 0.001; HKA: 179.1° ± 2.9° versus 179.9° ± 3.0°, respectively, p = 0.001). Within the DLM group, the MAD (R = 0.10, p = 0.032) and HKA (R = -0.13, p = 0.007) had a weak correlation with age. Conclusions: Patients with a torn DLM had more varus knee alignment than those with a torn SLM, and this trend did not increase with age after minimizing the effects of osteoarthritis. Therefore, surgical treatment may not be appropriate for asymptomatic DLM.

We aimed to compare intramedullary nails in widespread use in Norway on the basis of reoperation risk.Methods:We assessed data from 13,232 trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures treated with an intramedullary nail and registered in the Norwegian Hip Fracture Register between 2007 and 2019. The primary outcome measure was the risk of reoperation for various types of short and long intramedullary nails. Secondly, we compared risk of reoperation for the selected nails with respect to fracture type (AO/OTA type A1, A2, A3, and subtrochanteric fractures). Cox regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class was used to estimate hazard rate ratios (HRRs) for reoperation.Results:The mean patient age was 82.9 years, and 72.8% of the nails were used in the treatment of female patients. We included 8,283 short and 4,949 long nails. A1 fractures accounted for 29.8%, A2 for 40.6%, A3 for 7.2%, and subtrochanteric fractures for 22.4%. When comparing short nails regardless of fracture type, the TRIGEN INTERTAN had an increased risk of reoperation at 1 year (HRR, 1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 1.66]; p = 0.028) and 3 years (HRR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.61]; p = 0.011) postoperatively compared with the Gamma3. For individual fracture types, we found no significant differences in reoperation risk between the various types of short nails. When comparing long nails, the TRIGEN TAN/FAN had an increased risk of reoperation at 1 year (HRR, 3.05 [95% CI, 2.10 to 4.42]; p < 0.001) and 3 years (HRR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.82 to 3.54]; p < 0.001) postoperatively compared with the long Gamma3.Conclusions:This study may indicate a slightly increased risk of reoperation for the short TRIGEN INTERTAN compared with other short nails in widespread use in Norway. In analyses of long nails, the TRIGEN TAN/FAN nail was associated with a higher risk of reoperation in the treatment of trochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level III.

Two leading techniques involve the use of a transphyseal screw or a growth modulation plate. However, clinical references for the estimation of correction are lacking, and no consensus has been reached regarding the superiority of one technique over the other. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the rates of correction for distal femoral transphyseal screws and growth modulation plates in age- and sex-matched cohorts with coronal deformities.Methods:Thirty-one knees were included in each cohort on the basis of propensity scoring by chronological age and sex, and radiographic images were retrospectively reviewed preoperatively and postoperatively. Each case was measured for limb length, mechanical axis deviation (MAD), mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (LDFA), and bone age.Results:Both the MAD and LDFA rate of correction significantly differed between the screw and plate cohorts. The MAD rate of correction was observed to be 0.42 ± 0.37 mm/week (1.69 mm/month) in the plate cohort and 0.66 ± 0.51 mm/week (2.64 mm/month) in the screw cohort. The LDFA rate of correction was observed to be 0.12° ± 0.13°/week (0.50°/month) in the plate cohort and 0.19° ± 0.19°/week (0.77°/month) in the screw cohort.Conclusions:The current study provides simple clinical references for the rate of correction of MAD and the LDFA for 2 methods of hemiepiphysiodesis. The results suggest that transphyseal screws may correct coronal knee deformities during the initial treatment stage more quickly than growth modulation plates in distal femoral guided growth.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level III.

Our aim was to establish a clinically representative GN-PJI model that recapitulates biofilm formation in vivo. We also hypothesized that biofilm formation on the implant surface would affect its ability to osseointegrate.Methods:Three-dimensionally-printed medical-grade titanium hip implants were used to replace the femoral heads of male Sprague-Dawley rats. GN-PJI was induced using 2 bioluminescent Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains: a reference strain (PA14-lux) and a mutant biofilm-defective strain (ΔflgK-lux). Infection was monitored in real time using an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bacterial loads were quantified utilizing the viable colony count. Biofilm formation at the bone-implant interface was visualized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Implant stability, as an outcome, was directly assessed by quantifying osseointegration using microcomputed tomography, and indirectly assessed by identifying gait-pattern changes.Results:Bioluminescence detected by the IVIS was focused on the hip region and demonstrated localized infection, with greater ability of PA14-lux to persist in the model compared with the ΔflgK-lux strain, which is defective in biofilm formation. This was corroborated by MRI, as PA14-lux induced relatively larger implant-related abscesses. Biofilm formation at the bone-implant interface induced by PA14-lux was visualized using FE-SEM versus defective-biofilm formation by ΔflgK-lux. Quantitatively, the average viable colony count of the sonicated implants, in colony-forming units/mL, was 3.77 × 108for PA14-lux versus 3.65 × 103for ΔflgK-lux, with a 95% confidence interval around the difference of 1.45 × 108to 6.08 × 108(p = 0.0025). This difference in the ability to persist in the model was reflected significantly on implant osseointegration, with a mean intersection surface of 4.1 × 106± 1.99 × 106m2for PA14-lux versus 6.44 × 106± 2.53 × 106m2for ΔflgK-lux and 7.08 × 106± 1.55 × 106m2for the noninfected control (p = 0.048).Conclusions:To our knowledge, this proposed, novel in vivo biofilm-based model is the most clinically representative for GN-PJI to date, since animals can bear weight on the implant, poor osseointegration was associated with biofilm formation, and localized PJI was assessed by various modalities.Clinical Relevance:This model will allow for more reliable testing of novel biofilm-targeting therapeutics. © 2023 Authors.

Still, nonoperative treatment of weight-bearing stable fractures is controversial because of the scarcity of strong evidence. We investigated the influence of a concomitant unstable gravity stress test compared with a stable gravity stress test on outcomes after nonoperative treatment of weight-bearing stable fractures.Methods:We performed a prospective, noninferiority study on 149 patients with Weber B ankle fractures and stable weight-bearing radiographs. Gravity stress radiographs classified fractures as stable (SER2 [n = 88]) or partially unstable (SER4a [n = 61]). All were treated with a functional orthosis and weight-bearing was allowed; patients were followed for 2 years. The primary outcome was the Manchester-Oxford Foot and Ankle Questionnaire (MOXFQ), with a range from 0 to 100, in which lower scores indicate fewer symptoms. A noninferiority margin was prospectively defined as 7.5 points. The secondary outcomes included the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score, assessment of ankle congruence, and treatment-related adverse events.Results:The primary outcome data were available for 144 (96.6%) of 149 participants at 2 years. The between-group difference in the MOXFQ score was 1.0 point (95% confidence interval, -1.4 to 3.4 points; p = 0.397) in favor of the SER2 group, consistent with noninferiority. We found no appreciable between-group differences for any other outcome.Conclusions:In Weber B/SER ankle fractures that are stable on weight-bearing radiographs, are treated with removable orthoses, and are allowed to bear weight, a concomitant unstable gravity stress test (SER4a) was not associated with worse patient-reported or radiographic outcomes compared with a stable gravity stress test (SER2) at the 2-year follow-up. Thus, the identification of stress instability seems redundant, which questions the applicability of stress instability for surgical decision-making.Level of Evidence:Diagnostic Level II.

Eighteen pigs underwent labral augmentation (AUG group) using autologous Achilles tendon. No additional procedures were performed in the remaining pigs (control group). The pigs were killed at 6, 12, or 24 weeks postoperatively for histological assessment and measurement of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in synovial fluid.Results:All autografts were well placed in the labral defect in the AUG group, and good integration of the autograft with the remnant chondrolabral junction was observed at 24 weeks; only scar tissue was observed in the control group at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Fibrochondrocytes were concentrated at the transition between the autograft and native labrum at early time points, and the cells within the autograft labrum were predominantly fibrochondrocytes at 24 weeks. Rough and irregular articular cartilage surfaces were observed in 3 of the 6 samples in the AUG group at 24 weeks; the others appeared smooth. Focal cartilage erosion (predominantly in the acetabulum) occurred in all samples in the control group at 12 and 24 weeks. The Mankin score at 24 weeks was significantly lower in the AUG group than in the control group (mean [95% confidence interval]: 2.33 [1.06 to 3.6] versus 9 [8.06 to 9.94], p < 0.001). Likewise, the concentrations of all cytokines (in pg/mL) were significantly lower in the AUG group than in the control group at 24 weeks (IL-6: 166.6 [155.22 to 177.94] versus 245.9 [242.66 to 249.14], p < 0.001; IL-1β: 122.1 [116.4 to 127.83] versus 282.9 [280.29 to 285.51], p < 0.001; and TNF-α: 56.22 [53.15 to 59.29] versus 135 [131.66 to 138.24], p < 0.001).Conclusions:Autograft tendon used for labral augmentation was able to integrate well with the native labrum, which may help to preserve the articular cartilage.Clinical Relevance:Labral augmentation with autograft tendon may be a feasible option in cases of viable labral remnants. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study aimed to determine whether nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) can alleviate degenerative RCT and prevent postoperative retears by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in aged mice.Methods:We assigned 32 young (4 months) and 64 aged (19 to 20 months) male wild-type C57BL/6 mice to young, aged, and aged NAMPT-treated (ANAMPT) groups (n = 32 each). Mice in the ANAMPT group underwent subacromial injection with NAMPT-loaded fibrin gel, whereas the other 2 groups were injected with fibrin gel alone. Histological staining and each of the biomechanical and mitochondrial function tests were performed using 8 samples each.Results:Histological staining in the aged group revealed decreased cellularity, disrupted fiber architecture, and reduced type-I collagen content inside tendon tissues proximal to the enthesis, demonstrating the spontaneous development of age-related degenerative RCT. Compared with the young group, the maximum tendon-to-bone failure load (4.22 ± 0.81 versus 5.52 ± 0.81 N, p = 0.0106) and maximum suture cut-through force (0.83 ± 0.08 versus 1.07 ± 0.10 N, p = 0.0006) of degenerated tendon tissues in the aged group were significantly lower. Significantly reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and citrate synthase activity indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction was closely related to the development of the degenerative RCT. Furthermore, NAMPT-improved mitochondrial function alleviated age-induced degenerative histological changes and increased the maximum failure load (5.32 ± 0.68 N, p = 0.0375) and maximum suture cut-through force (0.99 ± 0.13 N, p = 0.0285).Conclusions:Spontaneously developed degenerative RCT in aged mice mimicked the clinical situation in elderly patients. NAMPT-improved mitochondrial function could alleviate age-induced degenerative RCT and prevent postoperative suture cut-through of tendons with degenerative RCT.Clinical Relevance:This study confirmed the spontaneous development of degenerative RCT in aged mice, which will facilitate future studies of this condition. The results also suggest that NAMPT offers a novel therapeutic approach for treating age-related degenerative RCT.

DESIGN: Intervention systematic review with meta-analysis LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases from October 20, 2018, to March 23, 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of exercise on pain self-efficacy to control, in adults with NSCLBP. DATA SYNTHESIS: We conducted a meta-analysis using a random-effects model. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) and judged the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. RESULTS: Seventeen trials were included, of which eight (n = 1121 participants; 60.6% female; mean age: 49.6 years) were included in the meta-analysis. Exercise increased pain self-efficacy by 3.02 points (95% confidence interval: 1.72, 4.32) on the 60-point Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire. The certainty of evidence was moderate; all trials were at high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There was moderate-certainty evidence that exercise increased pain self-efficacy in adults with NSCLBP. Future research should investigate if this effect is meaningful, whether it increases with more targeted treatments to enhance pain self-efficacy, and the effects on outcomes for adults with NSCLBP.

ENaCs and ASICs have wide ranging medical importance; for example, ENaCs play an important role in respiratory and renal function, and ASICs in ischaemia and inflammatory pain, as well as being implicated in memory and learning. Electrophysiological approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, have played an essential role in establishing the physiological properties of this diverse family, identifying an array of modulators and implicating them in an extensive range of cellular functions, including mechanosensation, acid sensation and synaptic modulation. Likewise, genetic studies in both invertebrates and vertebrates have played an important role in linking our understanding of channel properties to function at the cellular and whole animal/behavioural level. Drawing together genetic and physiological evidence is essential to furthering our understanding of the precise cellular roles of DEG/ENaC channels, with the diversity among family members allowing comparative physiological studies to dissect the molecular basis of these diverse functions.

Twenty-five young adults were divided into an RT+ET group (n = 13), which underwent 7 weeks of RT followed by 7 weeks of ET, and an ET-only group (n = 12), which performed 7 weeks of ET. Body composition, endurance performance and muscle biopsies were collected before RT (T1, baseline for RT+ET), before ET (T2, after RT for RT+ET and baseline for ET) and after ET (T3). Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine fibre cross-sectional area (fCSA), myonuclear content, myonuclear domain size, satellite cell number and mitochondrial content. Western blots were used to quantify markers of mitochondrial remodelling. Citrate synthase activity and markers of ribosome content were also investigated. RT improved body composition and strength, increased vastus lateralis thickness, mixed and type II fCSA, myonuclear number, markers of ribosome content, and satellite cell content (P < 0.050). In response to ET, both groups similarly decreased body fat percentage (P < 0.0001) and improved endurance performance (e.g. (Figure presented.), and speed at which the onset of blood lactate accumulation occurred, P < 0.0001). Levels of mitochondrial complexes I–IV in the ET-only group increased 32–66%, while those in the RT+ET group increased 1–11% (time, P < 0.050). Additionally, mixed fibre relative mitochondrial content increased 15% in the ET-only group but decreased 13% in the RT+ET group (interaction, P = 0.043). In conclusion, RT performed prior to ET had no additional benefits to ET adaptations. Moreover, prior RT seemed to impair mitochondrial adaptations to ET. (Figure presented.). Key points: Resistance training is largely underappreciated as a method to improve endurance performance, despite reports showing it may improve mitochondrial function. Although several concurrent training studies are available, in this study we investigated the effects of performing a period of resistance training on the performance and molecular adaptations to subsequent endurance training. Prior resistance training did not improve endurance performance and impaired most mitochondrial adaptations to subsequent endurance training, but this effect may have been a result of detraining from resistance training. © 2023 The Authors.

However, motoneurons are endowed with voltage-sensitive ion channels that create non-linearities in their input–output functions. Here we describe a role for the M-type potassium current, conducted by KCNQ channels, in the control of motoneuron recruitment in mice. Motoneurons were studied with whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in transverse spinal slices and identified based on delayed (fast) and immediate (slow) onsets of repetitive firing. M-currents were larger in delayed compared to immediate firing motoneurons, which was not reflected by variations in the presence of Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 subunits. Instead, a more depolarized spike threshold in delayed-firing motoneurons afforded a greater proportion of the total M-current to become activated within the subthreshold voltage range, which translated to a greater influence on their recruitment with little influence on their firing rates. Pharmacological activation of M-currents also influenced motoneuron recruitment at the population level, producing a rightward shift in the recruitment curve of monosynaptic reflexes within isolated mouse spinal cords. These results demonstrate a prominent role for M-type potassium currents in regulating the function of motor units, which occurs primarily through the differential control of motoneuron subtype recruitment. More generally, these findings highlight the importance of active properties mediated by voltage-sensitive ion channels in the differential control of motoneuron recruitment, which is a key mechanism for the gradation of muscle force. (Figure presented.). Key points: M-currents exert an inhibitory influence on spinal motor output. This inhibitory influence is exerted by controlling the recruitment, but not the firing rate, of high-threshold fast-like motoneurons, with limited influence on low-threshold slow-like motoneurons. Preferential control of fast motoneurons may be linked to a larger M-current that is activated within the subthreshold voltage range compared to slow motoneurons. Larger M-currents in fast compared to slow motoneurons are not accounted for by differences in Kv7.2 or Kv7.3 channel composition. The orderly recruitment of motoneuron subtypes is shaped by differences in the contribution of voltage-gated ion channels, including KCNQ channels. KCNQ channels may provide a target to dynamically modulate the recruitment gain across the motor pool and readily adjust movement vigour. © 2023 The Authors.

High glycogen (HG) and low glycogen (LG) containing hearts were perfused with 11 mM [5-3H]glucose and/or 4 mM [14C]βHB to measure glycolytic rates or βHB oxidation, respectively, then freeze-clamped for glycogen and metabolomic analyses. Free cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH] and mitochondrial [Q+]/[QH2] ratios were estimated using the lactate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase reaction, respectively. Phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations were measured using 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Rates of βHB oxidation in LG hearts were half that in HG hearts, with βHB oxidation directly proportional to glycogen content. βHB oxidation decreased glycolysis in all hearts. Glycogenolysis in glycogen-replete hearts perfused with βHB alone was twice that of hearts perfused with βHB and glucose, which had significantly higher levels of the glycolytic intermediates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, and higher free cytosolic [NAD+]/[NADH]. βHB oxidation increased the Krebs cycle intermediates citrate, 2-oxoglutarate and succinate, the total NADP/H pool, reduced mitochondrial [Q+]/[QH2], and increased the calculated free energy of ATP hydrolysis (∆GATP). Although βHB oxidation inhibited glycolysis, glycolytic intermediates were not depleted, and cytosolic free NAD remained oxidised. βHB oxidation alone increased Krebs cycle intermediates, reduced mitochondrial Q and increased ∆GATP. We conclude that glycogen facilitates cardiac βHB oxidation by anaplerosis. (Figure presented.). Key points: Ketone bodies (d-β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate) are increasingly recognised as important cardiac energetic substrates, in both healthy and diseased hearts. As 2-carbon equivalents they are cataplerotic, causing depletion of Krebs cycle intermediates; therefore their utilisation requires anaplerotic supplementation, and intra-myocardial glycogen has been suggested as a potential anaplerotic source during ketone oxidation. It is demonstrated here that cardiac glycogen does indeed provide anaplerotic substrate to facilitate β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation in isolated perfused rat heart, and this contribution was quantified using a novel pulse–chase metabolic approach. Further, using metabolomics and 31P-MR, it was shown that glycolytic flux from myocardial glycogen increased the heart's ability to oxidise βHB, and βHB oxidation increased the mitochondrial redox potential, ultimately increasing the free energy of ATP hydrolysis. © 2023 The Authors.

There are experimental data suggesting that male cardiomyocytes exhibit larger Ca2+ transients due to larger Ca2+ sparks and a higher excitation–contraction coupling gain; in addition, they exhibit a larger response to adrenergic stimulation with isoprenaline (ISO). Here, we studied whether there are sex differences relating to structural organization of the transverse tubular network and ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Surprisingly, we found that female cardiomyocytes exhibited a higher spark frequency in a range of spark magnitudes. While overall RyR expression and phosphorylation were the same, female cardiomyocytes had larger but fewer RyR clusters. The density of transverse t-tubules was the same, but male cardiomyocytes had more longitudinal t-tubules. The Ca2+ transients were similar in male and female cardiomyocytes under control conditions and in the presence of ISO. The synchrony of the Ca2+ transients was similar between sexes as well. Overall, our data suggest subtle sex differences in the Ca2+ influx and efflux pathways and their response to ISO, but these differences are balanced, resulting in similar Ca2+ transients in field-stimulated male and female cardiomyocytes. The higher spark frequency in female cardiomyocytes is related to the organization of RyRs into larger, but fewer clusters. (Figure presented.). Key points: During a heartbeat, the force of contraction depends on the amplitude of the calcium transient, which in turn depends on the amount of calcium released as calcium sparks through ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Previous studies suggest that cardiomyocytes from male compared to female mice exhibit larger calcium sparks, larger sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release and greater response to adrenergic stimulation triggering a fight-or-flight response. In contrast, we show that cardiomyocytes from female mice have a higher spark frequency during adrenergic stimulation and similar spark morphology. The higher spark frequency is related to the organization of ryanodine receptors into fewer, but larger clusters in female compared to male mouse cardiomyocytes. Despite subtle sex differences in cardiomyocyte structure and calcium fluxes, the differences are balanced, leading to similar calcium transients in cardiomyocytes from male and female mice. © 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we determined whether these synergies are robust across tasks with different mechanical constraints. We identified motor neuron synergies using principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlations between smoothed discharge rates of motor neurons. In part 1, we used simulations to validate these methods. The results suggested that PCA can accurately identify the number of common inputs and their distribution across active motor neurons. Moreover, the results confirmed that cross-correlation can separate pairs of motor neurons that receive common inputs from those that do not receive common inputs. In part 2, 16 individuals performed plantarflexion at three ankle angles while we recorded EMG signals from the gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and medialis (GM) and the soleus (SOL) with grids of surface electrodes. The PCA revealed two motor neuron synergies. These motor neuron synergies were relatively stable, with no significant differences in the distribution of motor neuron weights across ankle angles (P = 0.62). When the cross-correlation was calculated for pairs of motor units tracked across ankle angles, we observed that only 13.0% of pairs of motor units from GL and GM exhibited significant correlations of their smoothed discharge rates across angles, confirming the low level of common inputs between these muscles. Overall, these results highlight the modularity of movement control at the motor neuron level, suggesting a sensible reduction of computational resources for movement control. (Figure presented.). Key points: The CNS might generate movements by activating groups of motor neurons (synergies) with common inputs. We show here that two main sources of common inputs drive the motor neurons innervating the triceps surae muscles during isometric ankle plantarflexions. We report that the distribution of these common inputs is globally invariant despite changing the mechanical constraints of the tasks, i.e. the ankle angle. These results suggest the functional relevance of the modular organization of the CNS to control movements. © 2023 The Authors.

To shed light on this controversy, we compared the exercise pressor reflex between newly developed TRPV1+/+, TRPV1+/− and TRPV1−/− rats. Carotid arterial injection of capsaicin (0.5 μg), evoked significant pressor responses in TRPV1+/+ and TRPV1+/− rats, but not in TRPV1−/− rats. In acutely isolated dorsal root ganglion neurons innervating the gastrocnemius muscles, capsaicin evoked inward currents in neurons isolated from TRPV1+/+ and TRPV1+/− rats but not in neurons isolated from TRPV1−/− rats. The reflex was evoked by stimulating the tibial nerve in decerebrated rats whose femoral artery was either freely perfused or occluded. We found no difference between the reflex in the three groups of rats regardless of the patency of the femoral artery. For example, the peak pressor responses to contraction in TRPV1+/+, TRPV1+/− and TRPV1−/− rats with patent femoral arteries averaged 17.1 ± 7.2, 18.9 ± 12.4 and 18.4 ± 8.6 mmHg, respectively. Stimulation of the tibial nerve after paralysis with pancuronium had no effect on arterial pressure, findings which indicated that the pressor responses to contraction were not caused by electrical stimulation of afferent tibial nerve axons. We also found that expression levels of acid-sensing ion channel 1 and endoperoxide 4 receptor in the L4 and 5 dorsal root ganglia were not upregulated in the TRPV1−/− rats. We conclude that TRPV1 is not needed to evoke the exercise pressor reflex in rats whose contracting muscles have either a patent or an occluded arterial blood supply. (Figure presented.). Key points: A reflex arising in contracting skeletal muscle contributes to the increases in arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and breathing evoked by exercise. The sensory arm of the reflex comprises both mechanoreceptors and metaboreceptors, of which the latter signals that blood flow to exercising muscle is not meeting its metabolic demand. The nature of the channel on the metaboreceptor sensing a mismatch between supply and demand is controversial; some believe that it is the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. Using genetically engineered rats in which the TRPV1 channel is rendered non-functional, we have shown that it is not needed to evoke the metaboreflex. © 2023 The Authors.

For mechanosensitive EECs, force activates Piezo2 channels, which generate a very rapidly activating and inactivating (∼10 ms) cationic (Na+, K+, Ca2+) receptor current. Piezo2 receptor currents lead to a large and persistent increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) that lasts many seconds to sometimes minutes, suggesting signal amplification. However, intracellular calcium dynamics in EEC mechanotransduction remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the role of Ca2+ stores in EEC mechanotransduction. Mechanical stimulation of a human EEC cell model (QGP-1) resulted in a rapid increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and a slower decrease in ER stores Ca2+, suggesting the involvement of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Comparing murine primary colonic EECs with colonocytes showed expression of intercellular Ca2+ store receptors, a similar expression of IP3 receptors, but a >30-fold enriched expression of Ryr3 in EECs. In mechanically stimulated primary EECs, Ca2+ responses decreased dramatically by emptying stores and pharmacologically blocking IP3 and RyR1/3 receptors. RyR3 genetic knockdown by siRNA led to a significant decrease in mechanosensitive Ca2+ responses and 5-HT release. In tissue, pressure-induced increase in the Ussing short circuit current was significantly decreased by ryanodine receptor blockade. Our data show that mechanosensitive EECs use intracellular Ca2+ stores to amplify mechanically induced Ca2+ entry, with RyR3 receptors selectively expressed in EECs and involved in Ca2+ signalling, 5-HT release and epithelial secretion. (Figure presented.). Key points: A population of enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are specialized mechanosensors of the gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium that respond to mechanical stimulation with the release of important signalling molecules such as serotonin. Mechanical activation of these EECs leads to an increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) with a longer duration than the stimulus, suggesting intracellular Ca2+ signal amplification. In this study, we profiled the expression of intracellular Ca2+ store receptors and found an enriched expression of the intracellular Ca2+ receptor Ryr3, which contributed to the mechanically evoked increases in intracellular calcium, 5-HT release and epithelial secretion. Our data suggest that mechanosensitive EECs rely on intracellular Ca2+ stores and are selective in their use of Ryr3 for amplification of intracellular Ca2+. This work advances our understanding of EEC mechanotransduction and may provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for GI motility disorders. © 2022 The Authors.

During development, the maturation of OHC afferent connectivity is refined by coordinated spontaneous Ca2+ activity in both sensory and non-sensory cells. Calcium signalling in neonatal OHCs can be modulated by oncomodulin (OCM, β-parvalbumin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein. Here, we investigated whether OCM regulates OHC spontaneous Ca2+ activity and afferent connectivity during development. Using a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor (GCaMP6s) expressed in OHCs in wild-type (Ocm+/+) and Ocm knockout (Ocm−/−) littermates, we found increased spontaneous Ca2+ activity and upregulation of purinergic receptors in OHCs from Ocm−/− cochlea immediately following birth. The afferent synaptic maturation of OHCs was delayed in the absence of OCM, leading to an increased number of ribbon synapses and afferent fibres on Ocm−/− OHCs before hearing onset. We propose that OCM regulates the spontaneous Ca2+ signalling in the developing cochlea and the maturation of OHC afferent innervation. (Figure presented.). Key points: Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) exhibit spontaneous Ca2+ activity during a narrow period of neonatal development. OHC afferent maturation and connectivity requires spontaneous Ca2+ activity. Oncomodulin (OCM, β-parvalbumin), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein, modulates Ca2+ signals in immature OHCs. Using transgenic mice that endogenously expressed a Ca2+ sensor, GCaMP6s, we found increased spontaneous Ca2+ activity and upregulated purinergic receptors in Ocm−/− OHCs. The maturation of afferent synapses in Ocm−/− OHCs was also delayed, leading to an upregulation of ribbon synapses and afferent fibres in Ocm−/− OHCs before hearing onset. We propose that OCM plays an important role in modulating Ca2+ activity, expression of Ca2+ channels and afferent innervation in developing OHCs. © 2023 The Authors.

To elucidate the pathological impact of lipid hydroperoxides, we overexpressed glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), an enzyme that targets reduction of lipid hydroperoxides in membranes, in adult CuZn superoxide dismutase knockout (Sod1KO) mice that show accelerated muscle atrophy associated with loss of innervation. The gastrocnemius muscle from Sod1KO mice shows reduced mitochondrial respiration and elevated oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes and hydroperoxides) compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Overexpression of GPx4 improved mitochondrial respiration and reduced hydroperoxide generation in Sod1KO mice, but did not attenuate the muscle loss that occurs in Sod1KO mice. In contrast, contractile force generation is reduced in EDL muscle in Sod1KO mice relative to WT mice, and overexpression of GPx4 restored force generation to WT levels in Sod1KO mice. GPx4 overexpression also prevented loss of muscle contractility at the single fibre level in fast-twitch fibres from Sod1KO mice. Muscle fibres from Sod1KO mice were less sensitive to both depolarization and calcium at the single fibre level and exhibited a reduced activation by S-glutathionylation. GPx4 overexpression in Sod1KO mice rescued the deficits in both membrane excitability and calcium sensitivity of fast-twitch muscle fibres. Overexpression of GPx4 also restored the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity in Sod1KO gastrocnemius muscles. These data suggest that GPx4 plays an important role in preserving excitation–contraction coupling function and Ca2+ homeostasis, and in maintaining muscle and mitochondrial function in oxidative stress-induced sarcopenia. (Figure presented.). Key points: Knockout of CuZn superoxide dismutase (Sod1KO) induces elevated oxidative stress with accelerated muscle atrophy and weakness. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) plays a fundamental role in the reduction of lipid hydroperoxides in membranes, and overexpression of GPx4 improves mitochondrial respiration and reduces hydroperoxide generation in Sod1KO mice. Muscle contractile function deficits in Sod1KO mice are alleviated by the overexpression of GPx4. GPx4 overexpression in Sod1KO mice rescues the impaired muscle membrane excitability of fast-twitch muscle fibres and improves their calcium sensitivity. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity in Sod1KO muscles is decreased, and it is restored by the overexpression of GPx4. Our results confirm that GPx4 plays an important role in preserving excitation–contraction coupling function and Ca2+ homeostasis, and maintaining muscle and mitochondrial function in oxidative stress-induced sarcopenia. © 2023 The Authors.

Thirty male U23 cyclists (N = 30, age 20.1 ± 1.1 yrs, body mass 69.0 ± 6.9 kg, height 182.6 ± 6.2 cm, V̇O2max 73.8 ± 2.5 mL·kg−1·min−1) participated in this study. Design: Power output information was derived from laboratory and field-testing during pre-season and mean maximal power outputs (MMP) from racing season. Absolute and relative 5-min MMP, 5-min MMP after 2000 kJ (MMP2000 kJ), allometric scaling and the compound score were compared to the race score and podium (top 3) performance during a competitive season. Methods: Positive and negative predictive values were calculated for all significant performance variables for the likelihood of a podium performance. Results: The absolute 5-min MMP of the field test revealed the highest negative predictive capacity (82.4%, p = 0.012) for a podium performance. The compound score of the 5-min MMP2000 kJ demonstrated the highest positive and average predictive capacity (83.3%, 78.0%, p = 0.007 - respectively). The multi-linear regression analysis revealed a significant predictive capacity between performance variables and the race score (R2 = 0.55, p = 0.015). Conclusions: Collectively the results of the present study reveal that the compound score, alongside absolute power, was able to predict the highest positive and average likelihood for a podium performance.

Results: We enrolled 34 participants with concussion (early physical activity: n = 10, age = 15.8 ± 1.6 years, 70% female; no physical activity: n = 24, age = 16.0 ± 1.3 years, 50% female) and 21 uninjured controls (age = 16.0 ± 1.8 years, 48% female). Compared to controls, the no physical activity group reported worse sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 3.8 ± 2.7 vs 8.0 ± 4.9 points, p = 0.002) and single-task tandem gait time (13.7 ± 3.4 vs 21.2 ± 8.1 s, p = 0.0006), while the early physical activity group did not (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 3.8 ± 2.7 vs 5.8 ± 3.2 points, p = 0.38; single-task tandem gait: 13.7 ± 3.4 vs 19.0 ± 5.7 s, p = 0.08). Compared to controls, early/no physical activity groups reported worse dizziness (Dizziness Handicap Inventory: 2.0 ± 3.4 vs 22.9 ± 23.8 vs 27.4 ± 19.2 points, p < 0.0001). There were no significant between-group differences for dual-task tandem gait (24.1 ± 8.0 vs 24.8 ± 6.2 vs 26.6 ± 7.3 s, p = 0.57). Conclusions: The no physical activity group reported worse sleep quality and slower single-task tandem gait than controls, while both groups reported similar sleep quality and tandem gait. Early physical activity may promote sleep quality and postural stability, or early physical activity may be a function of improved sleep and postural stability after concussion. © 2023 Sports Medicine Australia",Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148756333,1984,0,,"SAS, STATA"

Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Twenty female college athletes with concussion history (age = 19.1 ± 1.5 years, height = 166.9 ± 6.7 cm, mass = 62.8 ± 6.9 kg, median total concussion = 1.0 [interquartile range = 1.0, 2.0]), and 28 female college athletes without concussion history (age = 19.1 ± 1.0 years, height = 172.7 ± 8.3 cm, mass = 65.4 ± 8.4 kg). Functional reaction time was assessed during jump landing and dominant and non-dominant limb cutting. Computerized assessments included simple, complex, Stroop, and composite reaction times. Partial correlations investigated the associations between functional and computerized reaction time assessments while covarying for time between computerized and functional reaction time assessments. Analysis of covariance compared functional and computerized reaction time, covarying for time since concussion. Results: There were no significant correlations between functional and computerized reaction time assessments (p-range = 0.318 to 0.999, partial correlation range = − 0.149 to 0.072). Reaction time did not differ between groups during any functional (p-range = 0.057 to 0.920) or computerized (p-range = 0.605 to 0.860) reaction time assessments. Conclusions: Post-concussion reaction time is commonly assessed via computerized measures, but our data suggest computerized reaction time assessments are not characterizing reaction time during sport-like movements in varsity-level female athletes. Future research should investigate confounding factors of functional reaction time. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150035702,1996,0,,R

Design: Prospective cohort study, secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial. Methods: Patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy performed a progressive calf muscle exercise program. At baseline and after 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks, patients completed the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment—Achilles questionnaire and performed the following physical tests: ankle dorsiflexion range of motion with a bent knee or an extended knee, calf muscle strength, jumping height and pain on palpation (Visual Analogue Scale; 0–100) and after 10 hops (Visual Analogue Scale-10-hops). Associations between baseline test results and improvement (Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment—Achilles scores) were determined using a Mixed Linear Model. Results: 80 patients were included. The mean Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment—Achilles score improved 20 points (95 % confidence interval, 16–25, P < .001) after 24 weeks. There were significant associations between the baseline ankle dorsiflexion range of motion with a bent knee (β 0.2, 95 % confidence interval 0.001 to 0.3, P = .049), the baseline pain provocation tests (Visual Analogue Scale palpation: β − 0.2; 95 % confidence interval: − 0.4 to − 0.1; P < .001, Visual Analogue Scale-10-hops: β − 0.3; 95 % confidence interval: − 0.4 to − 0.2; P < .001) and the change in the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment—Achilles score. Conclusions: In patients with chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy, easy-to-perform pain provocation tests have a clinically relevant prognostic value on patient-reported improvement. Patients with less pain during pain provocation tests at baseline have a better improvement in pain, function and activities after 24 weeks than patients with high baseline pain scores. © 2023 The Authors",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165720364,1954,0,,SPSS

Whilst compulsive exercise may impact mental health, the limited research exploring the relationship between compulsive exercise and psychosocial outcomes is equivocal. The majority of studies have examined eating disorder populations where the eating disorder pathology might account for distress. This study explores relationships between compulsive exercise and mental health. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Methods: Australian recreational exercisers and athletes (N = 1157; Mage 36.4, standard deviation = 12.9, 77 % female) recruited through sporting organisations, clubs, and gyms, completed measures of compulsive exercise, depression, anxiety, stress, life satisfaction, social physique anxiety, and self-esteem. Regression analyses examined relationships between dimensions of compulsive exercise and wellbeing. Results: After adjustment for eating disorder symptoms and sporting level, compulsive exercise was associated with increased risk of clinically-significant anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. Compulsive exercise was also associated with lower life satisfaction and self-esteem, and higher social physique anxiety. Notably, different dimensions of compulsive exercise had varying relationships with outcomes, and avoidance and rule-driven behaviour and lack of exercise enjoyment were associated with poorer mental health and wellbeing. Conclusions: Results suggest that compulsive exercise is uniquely associated with a range of psychosocial and mental health outcomes. Results support the need to improve identification and treatment of compulsive exercise in sport and exercise settings. Results highlight that mental health intervention is an important component of treatment, and treatments targeting symptoms related to avoidance and rule-driven behaviour, and anhedonia may be valuable treatment components for those with compulsive exercise. © 2023 The Author(s)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161557423,1969,1,"Extreme outliers identified (no details on how), and removed.",SPSS

Methods: Patients who were admitted to the institution with a diagnosis of anterior shoulder instability and who underwent arthroscopic surgery between July 2006 and February 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Minimum follow-up duration of the patients was 24 months. The recorded data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patients were examined. Patients aged ≥40 years, with a history of shoulder region fracture, inflammatory arthritis, a history of epilepsy, multidirectional instability, nontraumatic dislocation, and off-track lesions were excluded from the study. Shoulder lesions were documented and patient outcome evaluation was made with the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and visual analog scale (VAS). Results: A total of 340 patients were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 25.6 years (±6.49). The recurrent instability group had a significantly higher rate of anterior labroligamentous periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA) lesions compared to the primary instability group (40.6% vs. 24.6% respectively) (P =.033). Twenty-five patients (43.9%) had superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions in the primary instability group and 81 patients (28.6%) had SLAP lesions in the recurrent instability group (P =.035). OSS increased for both primary (from 35 [16-44] to 46 [36-48]) (P =.001) and recurrent instability groups (from 33 [6-45] to 47 [19-48]) (P =.001). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding postoperative VAS and OSS scores (P >.05). Conclusions: Successful results were obtained in patients younger than 40 years with both primary and recurrent anterior shoulder instability after arthroscopic treatment. ALPSA lesion prevalence was higher whereas SLAP lesion prevalence was lower in patients with recurrent instability. Although the postoperative OSS was comparable between the patient groups, the failure rate was higher in the recurrent instability patients. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168015760,2116,0,,SPSS

Both image-guided and landmark-based techniques have been utilized successfully for SSNB, though more consensus is needed regarding the optimal method of administration. This study aims to evaluate the theoretical effectiveness of a SSNB at 2 distinct anatomic landmarks and propose a simple, reliable way of administration for future clinical use. Methods: Fourteen upper extremity cadaveric specimens were randomly assigned to either receive an injection 1 cm medial to the posterior acromioclavicular (AC) joint vertex or 3 cm medial to the posterior AC joint vertex. Each shoulder was injected with a 10 ml methylene blue solution at the assigned location, and gross dissection was performed to evaluate the anatomic diffusion of the dye. The presence of dye was specifically assessed at the suprascapular notch, supraspinatus fossa, and spinoglenoid notch to determine the theoretic analgesic effectiveness of a SSNB at these 2 injection sites. Results: Methylene blue diffused to the suprascapular notch in 57.1% of the 1-cm group and 100% of the 3-cm group, the supraspinatus fossa in 71.4% of the 1-cm group and 100% of the 3-cm group, and the spinoglenoid notch in 100% of the 1-cm group and 42.9% of the 3-cm group. Conclusion: Given its superior coverage at the more proximal sensory branches of the suprascapular nerve, a SSNB injection performed 3 cm medial to the posterior AC joint vertex provides more clinically adequate analgesia than an injection site 1 cm medial to the AC junction. Performing a SSNB injection at this location allows for an effective method of anesthetizing the suprascapular nerve. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168747803,2076,0,,

Previous studies have shown evidence of sociodemographic disparities with these injuries. The purpose of this nationwide study was to better understand these disparities based on ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status, in order to inform future health care strategies. Methods: Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) is a no-fault comprehensive compensation scheme encompassing all of Aotearoa/New Zealand (population in 2018, 4.7 million). Using the ACC database, traumatic rotator cuff injuries were identified between January 2010 and December 2018. Injuries were categorized by sex, ethnicity, age, and socioeconomic deprivation index of the claimant. Results: During the 9-year study period, there were 351,554 claims accepted for traumatic rotator cuff injury, which totaled more than NZ$960 million. The greatest proportion of costs was spent on vocational support (49.8%), then surgery (26.3%), rehabilitation (13.1%), radiology (8.1%), general practitioner (1.6%), and “Other” (1.1%). Asian, Māori (indigenous New Zealanders), and Pacific peoples were under-represented in the age-standardized proportion of total claims and had lower rates of surgery than Europeans. Māori had higher proportion of costs spent on vocational support and lower proportions spent on radiology, rehabilitation, and surgery than Europeans. Males had higher number and costs of claims and were more likely to have surgery than females. There were considerably fewer claims from areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. Discussion and Conclusion: This large nationwide study demonstrates the important and growing economic burden of rotator cuff injuries. Indirect costs, such as vocational supports, are a major contributor to the cost, suggesting improving treatment and rehabilitation protocols would have the greatest economic impact. This study has also identified sociodemographic disparities that need to be addressed in order to achieve equity in health outcomes. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143916762,2289,0,,GraphPad Prism

We also examined the effect of glenoid implant retroversion on clinical outcomes. Hypothesis: In both ATSA and RTSA, computer navigation would be associated with equal or better outcomes with fewer complications. Final glenoid version and degree of correction would not show outcome differences. Material and methods: A total of 216 ATSAs and 533 RTSAs were performed using preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Matched cohorts (2:1) for age, gender, and follow-up for cases without intraoperative navigation were compared using all standard shoulder arthroplasty clinical outcome metrics. Two subanalyses were performed on navigated cases comparing glenoids positioned greater or less than 10° of retroversion and glenoids corrected more or less than 15°. Results: For ASTA, no statistical differences were found between the navigated and non-navigated cohorts for postoperative complications, glenoid implant loosening, or revision rate. No significant differences were seen in any of the ATSA outcome metrics besides higher internal and external rotation in the navigated cohort. For RTSA, the navigated cohort showed an ARR of 1.7% (95% CI 0%, 3.4%) for postoperative complications and 0.7% (95% CI 0.1%, 1.2%) for dislocations. No difference was found in the revision rate, glenoid implant loosening, acromial stress fracture rates, or scapular notching. Navigated RTSA patients demonstrated significant improvements over non-navigated patients in internal rotation, external rotation, maximum lifting weight, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant, and Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) scores. For the navigated subcohorts, ATSA cases with a higher degree of final retroversion showed significant improvement in pain, Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), SST, University of California–Los Angeles shoulder score (UCLA), and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores. No significant differences were found in the RTSA subcohort. Higher degrees of version correction showed improvement in external rotation, SST, and Constant scores for ATSA and forward elevation, internal rotation, pain, SST, Constant, ASES, UCLA, SPADI, and SAS scores for RTSA. Conclusion: The use of intraoperative navigation shoulder arthroplasty is safe, produces at least equally good outcomes at 2 years as standard instrumentation does without any increased risk of complications. The effect of final implant position above or below 10° of glenoid retroversion and correction more or less than 15° does not negatively impact outcomes. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169164891,2005,0,,

The “circles measurement” on Alexander views was proposed to enable a clear assessment of displacement in ACJ dislocations. However, the method and its ABC classification were introduced on a Sawbones model based on exemplary Rockwood scenarios without soft tissue. This is the first in vivo study to investigate the circles measurement. We aimed to compare this new measurement method with the Rockwood classification and the previously described semiquantitative degree of dynamic horizontal translation (DHT). Methods: A total of 100 consecutive patients (87 men and 13 women) with acute ACJ dislocations between 2017 and 2020 were included retrospectively. The mean age was 41 years (range, 18-71 years). ACJ dislocations on panoramic stress views were classified according to Rockwood type (type II, n = 8; type IIIA, n = 9; type IIIB, n = 24; type IV, n = 7; and type V, n = 52). On Alexander views, where the hand of the affected arm rested on the contralateral shoulder, the circles measurement and the semiquantitative degree of DHT (none, n = 6; partial, n = 15; or complete, n = 79) were assessed. Convergent and discriminant validity of the circles measurement (including its ABC classification according to displacement) with the coracoclavicular distance and Rockwood types, as well as the semiquantitative degree of DHT, was tested. Results: The circles measurement showed a strong correlation with the coracoclavicular distance according to the Rockwood classification (r = 0.66, P < .001) and differentiated between Rockwood types according to the ABC classification, including types IIIA and IIIB. The circles measurement correlated with the semiquantitative method of assessing DHT (r = 0.61, P < .001). Measurement values were smaller in cases without DHT than in cases with partial DHT (P = .008). Cases with complete DHT had respectively larger measurement values (P < .001). Conclusion: In this first in vivo study, the circles measurement allowed differentiation between Rockwood types according to the ABC classification in acute ACJ dislocations with a single measurement and correlated with the semiquantitative degree of DHT. On the basis of these validations of the circles measurement, its use for evaluating ACJ dislocations is recommended. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159109287,2145,0,,SPSS

Local anesthetic can be injected in the perineural space of the brachial plexus by a single shot or continuously by an indwelling catheter. Although previous studies have compared efficacy and direct cost of single shot to catheters, few have evaluated unanticipated costs of ongoing care or complications. Pulmonary complications can lead to unexpected admissions and emergency department visits. The purpose of the study was to identify unplanned hospital admissions or emergency department visits related to regional anesthesia after shoulder surgery and determine the additional associated costs. Methods: A series of 1888 shoulder surgeries were identified in 1856 unique patients at a single, large academic center. As part of an interscalene nerve catheter program, a continuous interscalene block (CIB) was given to 1728 patients, whereas 160 patients had a single-shot interscalene block (SSIB). A hospital-employed quality control nurse contacted all patients receiving a CIB at 1, 2, 7, and 14 days following surgery. All emergency department visits and readmissions were recorded, and the associated billing charges were reviewed for the inpatient and any outpatient visits immediately preceding or immediately following the readmission. The regional average Medicare fee schedule was used to determine a cost for these episodes of care. Results: Of the 1728 patients who had CIB, 10 patients were readmitted following open or arthroscopic surgery or presented to the emergency department in the immediate postoperative period for pulmonary compromise. No patient in the SSIB group had an emergency department visit or readmission. The average age of the 10 patients with readmission was 60 years (7 females, 3 males). The majority were diagnosed with hypoxemia on admission (R09.02). Length of stay during readmission ranged from 0 to 4 days, with 1 patient requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The average cost of admission to the hospital or visit to the emergency department was $6849 (range, $1988-$19,483). These costs were primarily related to chest radiographs and electrocardiogram (9/10), chest computed tomography (CT) with contrast (3/10), and head CT (2/10). Conclusion: Although uncommon, unanticipated pulmonary complications after CIB can result in significant cost compared to SSIB. The indirect costs of pulmonary workup after readmission or emergency department workup may be overlooked if only considering direct costs, such as medication charges, medical supplies, and physician fees. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152698764,2210,0,,

The incidence of revision TSA is increasing because of the increase in primary TSA and the increased utilization of TSA in younger patients. Conducting revision TSA as an outpatient procedure would be beneficial in limiting expenditure and resource allocation but must show a similar complication profile compared to inpatient revision TSA in order to justify its clinical value. The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of outpatient revision TSA to inpatient revision TSA and outpatient primary TSA. Methods: The American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried from 2010-2019 to identify all patients who underwent revision TSA (n = 1456) in either an inpatient or outpatient setting, as well as patients who underwent primary TSA in an outpatient setting (n = 2630). Relevant demographic characteristics were compared between the outpatient revision group and both the inpatient revision and outpatient primary groups. Postoperative complications, readmission, and reoperation rates were also compared between the groups. Results: Patients undergoing inpatient revision TSA exhibited increased rates of preoperative hypertension (P = .013) and had increased prevalence of severe American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (P = .021) compared to patients undergoing outpatient revision TSA. Patients undergoing outpatient revision TSA were significantly more likely to experience complications (P < .001), have longer surgical times (P < .001), and undergo readmission (P = .006) and reoperation (P = .049) compared to patients undergoing outpatient primary TSA. There was no significant increase in rates of overall complication, readmission, or reoperation between patients undergoing revision TSA in an outpatient vs. an inpatient setting. Conclusion: Outpatient revision TSA has higher complication rates, readmission, and reoperation rates compared to outpatient primary TSA, similar to previous findings when comparing revision and primary TSA done as an inpatient. However, there was no increased risk of complications, readmission, or reoperation for outpatient revision TSA compared to inpatient revision TSA. Outpatient revision TSA should be considered by orthopedic surgeons in patients who are medically healthy to undergo the procedure as an outpatient surgery. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139035941,2315,0,,SPSS

It is currently unknown how often overhead athletes who undergo isolated posteromedial osteophyte resection subsequently require UCL reconstruction (UCLR). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report outcomes following arthroscopic resection of posteromedial osteophytes in overhead athletes and determine whether overhead athletes who underwent arthroscopic posteromedial osteophyte resection for posteromedial impingement went on to require UCL surgery. We hypothesized that there would be a high rate of RTS following osteophyte resection and that players who underwent arthroscopic posteromedial osteophyte resection would have a >10% risk of requiring subsequent UCLR or UCL repair. Materials and methods: All patients who underwent elbow arthroscopy from 2010-2020 at a single institution were reviewed. Patients were included if they underwent isolated arthroscopic posteromedial osteophyte resection without concomitant UCL surgery, were overhead athletes at the onset of posteromedial impingement symptoms, and had no history of elbow surgery. Primary outcomes included RTS rate, complications, and subsequent shoulder and/or elbow injury and surgery, as well as several patient-reported outcome measures (Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic score, Timmerman-Andrews elbow score, and Conway-Jobe score). Results: Overall, 36 overhead athletes were evaluated at 5.1 ± 3.4 years postoperatively, including 28 baseball pitchers, 3 baseball catchers, 3 softball players, 1 tennis player, and 1 volleyball player. Of the overhead athletes, 77% were able to RTS; the mean Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic and satisfaction scores were 70 and 75, respectively; and 89% of athletes had either excellent (73%) or good (16%) Conway-Jobe scores at long-term follow-up. Subsequent UCLR was required in 18% of baseball pitchers (n = 5) at a median of 13 months postoperatively. Of the 5 UCLRs, 3 were performed shortly after posteromedial osteophyte resection (6, 7, and 13 months postoperatively) whereas the other 2 were performed at 6.2 and 7.5 years postoperatively. Conclusion: Following arthroscopic posteromedial osteophyte resection, 77% of athletes were able to RTS. Baseball pitchers who undergo arthroscopic resection of posteromedial osteophytes for posteromedial impingement have an 18% risk of subsequent UCLR. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143917004,2303,0,,

We hypothesized that (1) metal-augmented baseplate prevents the medialization of the joint line and preserves glenoid bone stock similarly to bony increased-offset (BIO)-RSA and (2) bone graft viability and healing in BIO-RSA patients become compromised over time. Materials and methods: Eighty-one patients (83 shoulders) underwent glenoid lateralization with bone (BIO-RSA group, 44) or metal-augmented baseplate (metallic increased-offset [MIO]-RSA group, 39) and a minimum follow-up of 24 months were included. The orientation and direction of glenoid erosion was identified and recorded using computerized 3D planning. Active range of motion, and the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder (WOOS) index were assessed before arthroplasty and at the last follow-up visits. Radiographic changes around the glenoid and humeral components were assessed. Healing and thickness of bone graft were evaluated by predefined criteria. Postoperative global glenoid inclination (β angle) and retroversion were also measured. Results: Delta scores of active anterior elevation were higher in the MIO-RSA group (P = .027). The differences in the other planes of shoulder motion and in WOOS index scores between the groups were not significant. Preoperative glenoid retroversion was higher in BIO-RSA patients, and glenoid inclination was similar in both groups. Type B2 and B3 glenoids had a posterior-central (91%) and posterior-superior (90%) erosion with a mean posterior humeral head subluxation of 76% and 78%, respectively. The direction of erosion in type E2 and E3 glenoids was posterior-superior, with a mean posterior humeral head subluxation of 74%. The rate of high position of the glenosphere was higher in the BIO-RSA group (P = .022), whereas the values of β angle and postoperative retroversion were similar in the 2 groups. BIO-RSA group showed radiolucent lines <2 mm around the bone graft in 16 patients (36.4%) and decreased thickness in 15 (34.1%). Incomplete baseplate seating was found in 4 MIO-RSA patients (10%). We found higher rates of humerus condensation lines in MIO-RSA patients (P = .01) and higher rates of cortical thinning and tuberosity resorption in the BIO-RSA group (P = .027 and P = .004, respectively). Conclusion: Metal-augmented glenoid is a suitable alternative to BIO-RSA to preserve bone and prevent the medialization of the joint line in arthritic glenoid with multiplanar glenoid deformity. Bone and metal augmentation provided satisfactory clinical outcomes. Bone graft resorption in BIO-RSA patients raise concern about the risk of baseplate loosening and requires further long-term studies. © 2023",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171172757,2046,0,,STATA

This study was conducted to prove the hypothesis that RSA would improve emotional status and quality of life. Methods: Fifty patients undergoing RSA for rotator cuff insufficiency were prospectively included. Evaluation using the visual analog scale pain score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, subjective shoulder value, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Abbreviated scale of World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) was performed before surgery and at 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Results: The mean visual analog scale pain score, HADS-depression score, and HADS-anxiety score showed a significant decrease from 6.6, 13.3, and 13.9 before surgery to 1.5, 3.9, and 3.7 after 12 months after surgery, respectively (all P < .001). The mean ASES score, WHOQOL-BREF score, and subjective shoulder value showed a significant improvement from 28.5, 32.3, and 23.6% to 81.3, 79.1, and 78.4%, respectively (all P < .001). All outcome measurements showed a significant improvement from 6 weeks after RSA. In multivariate analysis, age was an independent predictor of the final ASES score and WHOQOL-BREF score (P = .037 and .004, respectively). Conclusion: This study showed a sequential improvement of emotional status and quality of life as well as functional recovery with pain relief from 6 weeks after RSA in patients with rotator cuff insufficiency. Especially, younger patients had better postoperative functional ability and quality of life. These findings suggest that RSA for rotator cuff insufficiency provides a rapid improvement of emotional status and quality of life. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143916893,2349,0,,SPSS

To our knowledge, only 1 previously published study has assessed the ability of Blueprint software to predict actual postoperative ROM after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA). The hypotheses of this study were that (1) mean Blueprint-predicted impingement-free ROM would be statistically similar to the mean actual ROM 1 year after RTSA and (2) there would be a correlation between Blueprint-predicted impingement-free ROM and the actual ROM 1 year after RTSA. Materials and methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent Blueprint planning prior to undergoing RTSA from March 2017 through May 2021 was performed. At 1-year follow-up, flexion, external rotation at the side, abduction, external rotation in the abducted position, internal rotation in the abducted position, and internal rotation behind the back were measured. The preoperatively predicted flexion, extension, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation were recorded using Blueprint software. The group 1 analysis examined the predicted vs. actual ROM of all 127 patients regardless of whether intraoperative component modifications were made. The group 2 analysis examined the predicted vs. actual ROM of only the patients who did not undergo intraoperative changes that would affect the preoperative ROM prediction (n = 97). The group 3 analysis examined the predicted vs. actual ROM of group 2 combined with the 30 patients who underwent post hoc Blueprint planning modifications to account for the changes made intraoperatively (combined sample size of 127). Results: Of the 141 patients, 127 (90%) were available for 1-year follow-up. When the mean values of all 3 groups were examined, the actual ROM and predicted ROM were statistically significantly different (P < .0001) for flexion, external rotation, abduction, abduction–external rotation, and abduction–internal rotation. In group 1, a very weak or poor correlation was found between predicted internal rotation and actual abducted internal rotation (r = 0.19, P = .04). For all other ROM metrics in groups 1, 2, and 3, there were no correlations between predicted and actual ROM (P ≥ .07). Conclusions: In its current state, preoperative Blueprint 3-dimensional computed tomography planning software is unable to accurately predict ROM 1 year after RTSA. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150372447,2252,0,,

Same-day discharge is perceived as beneficial for most patients as well as our health care system, and the number of shoulder procedures performed as same-day surgery has increased substantially. However, the potential benefits of same-day discharge after shoulder arthroplasty may be negatively influenced by unexpected readmissions. As such, an in-depth analysis of readmission rates after primary shoulder arthroplasty is particularly timely. Methods: The National Readmissions Database was queried for primary shoulder arthroplasty procedures performed in the United States between 2016 and 2018. National incidences were calculated, and indications, patient demographic characteristics, comorbidities, facility characteristics, and rates and causes of 30- and 90-day readmissions were determined for all procedures and compared between anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), anatomic hemiarthroplasty (HA), and RSA. Results: During the study period, 336,672 primary shoulder arthroplasties were performed (37% TSAs, 57% RSAs, and 6% HAs). In 2018, national incidences per 100,000 inhabitants were 22.64 for RSA, 12.70 for TSA, and 1.50 for HA. The utilization of these procedures between 2016 and 2018 increased for RSA, decreased for HA, and remained constant for TSA, but these changes did not reach the level of statistical significance. The average all-cause 30-day readmission rates were 3.63%, 1.92%, and 3.81% for RSA, TSA, and HA, respectively, and the average all-cause 90-day readmission rates were 7.76%, 4.37%, and 9.18%, respectively. For both RSA and HA, the most common surgical diagnosis for 30-day and 90-day readmissions was dislocation (0.45% and 0.99%, respectively, for RSA and 0.21% and 0.67%, respectively, for HA). For TSA, the most common surgical diagnosis for 30-day readmission was infection (0.11%); however, this was surpassed by dislocation (0.28%) at 90 days. Conclusion: RSA surpassed TSA as the most frequently performed shoulder arthroplasty procedure in the United States between 2016 and 2018. During this period, the 90-day readmission rate was not negligible, with dislocation and infection as the leading orthopedic causes of readmission. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85150371474,2255,0,,"MATLAB, Python"

To this end, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted. Methods: According to the updated guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, all related literature in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from their establishment to March 1, 2022, were searched systematically. Outcome measures included the Constant score, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index, visual analog scale (VAS) score, shoulder joint range of motion (ROM), and failure events of rotator cuff healing. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of RCT. Results: Two independent reviewers (Chen, Wu) reviewed 275 articles, of which only five met the inclusion criteria, and four were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 302 patients. The overall risk of bias was high in two RCTs, unclear in one, and low in two. Considering the clinical outcomes, the Constant score (P = .08 mean deviation [MD], 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.42 to 6.53), WORC (P = .23; MD, 3.32; 95%CI, −2.15 to 8.79), VAS score (P = .09; MD −1.27; 95%CI, −2.75 to 0.21), ROM (P = .1; MD, 4.75; 95%CI, −0.98 to 10.48), and failure events of rotator cuff healing (P = .78; odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95%CI, 0.32 to 2.37) did not significantly differ between the abduction brace and simple sling after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Conclusion: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that wearing abduction braces after rotator cuff repair neither improved the Constant score, VAS, and WORC scores, and ROM of the shoulder joint, nor did it reduce the risk of re-tearing.

Furthermore, no test has had specificity assessed. The posterolateral rotatory drawer (PLRD) test is thought to have improved diagnostic accuracy over other tests in the awake patient. The aim of this study is to formally assess this test using reference standards in a large cohort of patients. Methods: A total of 106 eligible patients were identified for inclusion from a single-surgeon database of operative procedures. Examination under anesthetic (EUA) and arthroscopy were chosen as the reference standards to compare the PLRD test against. Only patients with a clearly documented PLRD test finding performed preoperatively in the clinic, and a clearly documented EUA and/or arthroscopic findings from surgery were included. A total of 102 patients underwent EUA, 74 of whom also underwent arthroscopy. Twenty-eight patients had EUA, and then an open procedure without arthroscopy. Four patients had arthroscopy without a clearly documented EUA. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Thirty-seven patients had a positive PLRD test, and 69 had a negative test. Compared to the reference standard of EUA (n = 102), the PLRD test had a sensitivity of 97.3% (85.8%-99.9%) and a specificity of 98.5% (91.7%-100%) (PPV = 0.973, NPV = 0.985). Compared to the reference standard of arthroscopy (n = 78), the PLRD test had a sensitivity of 87.5% (61.7%-98.5%) and a specificity of 98.4% (91.3%-100%) (PPV = 0.933, NPV = 0.968). Compared to either reference standard (n = 106), the PLRD test has a sensitivity of 94.7% (82.3%-99.4%) and a specificity of 98.5% (92.1%-100%) (PPV = 0.973, NPV = 0.971). Conclusion: The PLRD test demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 94.7% and specificity of 98.5% with high positive and negative predictive values. This test is recommended as the primary diagnostic tool for LCL insufficiency in the awake patient and should be widely incorporated into surgical training. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171792216,2029,0,,MedCalc

Joint incongruity due to posterolateral unlocking leads to shear and compression stress of the internal aspect of the humeroulnar joint. We carried out long-term analysis of patients with posterolateral elbow instability in order to determine whether, in addition to improving their symptoms, reconstruction of the lateral collateral ligament complex may play a protective role against the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. We hypothesized that ligament reconstruction according to the technique of O'Driscoll stabilizes the elbow and also limits the development of osteoarthritis in the long term. Methods: Patients with symptomatic posterolateral instability of the elbow and who underwent ligament reconstruction according to the technique of O'Driscoll from January 1995 to December 2010 were identified and retrospectively included for 2 follow-up evaluations at a mean of 5 and 14 years. Results: Fourteen elbows in 14 patients were included. All had a negative lateral pivot shift test and none reported a new episode of instability. Two patients (14%) had osteoarthritis. The 2 radiographic evaluations showed no progression of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis developed in 33% of patients with intra-articular fracture. In simple dislocations, pre-existing osteoarthritic lesions were stabilized and there were no new cases of osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Elbow ligament reconstruction according to the technique of O'Driscoll gives effective posterolateral stabilization and appears to protect against progression to osteoarthritic degeneration in the long term. In the absence of associated lesions, it prevents the development of osteoarthritis or the worsening of pre-existing osteoarthritis. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152422270,2195,0,,GraphPad Prism

Methods and materials: Nineteen consecutive transolecranon fracture dislocations were retrospectively reviewed. Data collection included patient demographics, fracture classifications, surgical management, and failure with instability. Distance between the center of the radial head and the center of the capitellum was measured on initial radiographs by 2 independent raters on 3 separate occasions. Statistical analysis was used to compare the median displacement between patients who required collateral ligament repair for stability and those who did not. Results: Sixteen cases with a mean age of 57 years (range 32-85) were analyzed with an inter-rater Pearson coefficient of 0.89 for displacement measurement. Median displacement where collateral ligament repair was needed and performed was 17.13 mm (interquartile range [IQR] = 10.43-23.88) compared with 4.63 mm (IQR = 2.68-6.58) where collateral ligament repair was not performed and not required (P = .002). In 4 cases, ligament repair was not performed initially but deemed necessary based on clinical outcome and postoperative and intraoperative images. Of these, the median displacement was 15.59 mm (IQR = 10.09-21.20), and 2 of these required revision fixation. Discussion: Where displacement on initial radiographs exceeded 10 mm, lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL) repair was required in all cases (red group). If less than 5 mm, ligament repair was not required in any case (green group). Between 5 and 10 mm, following fracture fixation, the elbow must be screened carefully to assess for any instability and a low threshold set for LUCL repair to prevent posterolateral rotatory instability (amber group). Using these findings, we propose a traffic light model to predict the need for collateral ligament repair in transolecranon fractures and dislocation. © 2023 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171795241,2036,1,"No details on how these were identified, but removed.",R

Nailfold capillaroscopy is a practical and inexpensive diagnostic technique used to evaluate the health status of peripheral microcirculation, and recently, its use has found other indications in addition to that of diagnosing connective tissue diseases and Raynaud phenomenon. We verified the possible indirect contribution of nailfold capillaroscopy in the identification of peripheral microcirculation disturbances in a group of patients with rotator cuff tear and whether these possible alterations could be related to rotator cuff tear size. Materials and methods: A case-control study was performed. One hundred patients (56 male, 44 female; mean age ± standard deviation [SD]: 60.46 ± 5.46 years) with different-sized posterosuperior cuff tears and 100 healthy controls (38 male, 62 female; mean age ± SD: 60.40 ± 6.34 years) were submitted to capillaroscopic examination. The following parameters were examined: capillary morphology and density, avascular areas, visibility of the subpapillary venous plexus, enlarged and giant capillaries, ectasias and microaneurysms, neoangiogenesis, hemosiderin deposits, pericapillary edema, and capillary blood flow. Severe exclusion criteria were applied. Statistical analysis was performed. Results: Visibility of subpapillary venous plexus (P < .001), pericapillary edema (P < .001), capillary blood flow (P < .001), ectasias and microaneurysms (P < .001), and neoangiogenesis (P = .04) were significantly associated with presence of a rotator cuff tear. Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that microcirculation disorder has a relevant role in the genesis of cuff degeneration and, consequently, of tendon rupture. However, these alterations do not seem to be related to rotator cuff tear size. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144813642,2341,0,,"G*Power, JASP"

The purpose of this study was to compare rates of recurrent instability and reoperation, as well as patient-reported outcome measures, between Latarjet and arthroscopic Bankart repair with remplissage surgery patients. The authors hypothesized that there would be no difference in rates of recurrent instability, reoperation, and postoperative outcomes between patients who underwent Latarjet surgery and patients who underwent Bankart repair with concomitant remplissage postoperatively. Materials and methods: All patients who underwent primary shoulder stabilization for shoulder instability from 2014 to 2019 were screened. Latarjet and Bankart repair with remplissage patients were included if arthroscopic surgery was performed in response to anterior shoulder instability. Recurrent instability, revision, shoulder range of motion, return to sport (RTS), and patient-reported outcome measures (Oxford Shoulder Instability, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form scores) were compared between groups. Results: Overall, 43 Latarjet patients (age: 29.8 ± 12.1 years, 36 males 7 females) and 28 Bankart repair with remplissage patients (age: 28.2 ± 8.8 years, 25 males 3 females) were included with a mean follow-up of 3.3 ± 1.9 years. Patients who underwent Latarjet surgery had larger amounts of bone loss (19% vs. 11%, P < .001), a lower rate of off-track Hill-Sachs lesions (47% vs. 82%, P < .001), and more frequently had a history of chronic shoulder dislocations (88% vs. 43%, P < .001) compared to Bankart repair with remplissage patients. Latarjet patients less frequently reported feeling subjective shoulder instability after surgery (21% vs. 50%, P = .022), which was defined as feeling apprehension or experiencing a shoulder subluxation or dislocation event. There were no differences in rates of postoperative dislocation, revision, reoperation, or RTS, as well as patient-reported outcome scores, between groups (all P > .05). Conclusion: Despite differences in osseous defects, Latarjet and Bankart repair with remplissage patients had similar rates of clinical, patient-reported, and RTS outcomes at a mean of 3.3 years postoperatively. Latarjet surgery patients may be less likely to experience subjective shoulder instability postoperatively than patients who undergo Bankart repair with concomitant remplissage. © 2022 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148754594,2242,0,,R

The kinematic data and vGRF of 9 rearfoot strikers at 12, 14, and 16 km/h were collected using a motion capture system and an instrumented treadmill. The input variables were screened by factor loading and utilized to predict vGRF with the WNN. Nine kinematic variables were selected, corresponding to nine principal components, mainly focusing on the knee and ankle joints. The prediction results of vGRF were effective and accurate at different speeds, namely, the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) > 0.98 (0.984–0.988), the normalized root means square error (NRMSE) < 15% (9.34–11.51%). The NRMSEs of impact force (8.18–10.01%), active force (4.92–7.42%), and peak time (7.16–12.52%) were less than 15%. There was a small number (peak, 4.12–6.18%; time, 4.71–6.76%) exceeding the 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Bland-Altman method. The knee joint was the optimal location for estimating vGRF, followed by the ankle. There were high accuracy and agreement for predicting vGRF with the peak and peak time at 12, 14, and 16 km/h. Therefore, factor loading could be a valid method to screen kinematic variables in artificial neural networks. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168858069,2562,0,,

In contrast, the present study experimentally analysed a psychological process (i.e., self-validation) through which thought morality can influence attitudes and intentions. Two hundred and forty-two participants (122 males and 120 females) were randomly assigned to read a message either against or in favour of legalising several doping behaviours in sports, then listed their thoughts regarding that proposal. Next, they were randomly assigned to perceive their thoughts as either moral or immoral, then indicated the extent to which they considered their thoughts as valid. Finally, participants reported their attitudes and intentions regarding the legalisation proposal. As hypothesised, the anti-legalisation (vs. pro-legalisation) message produced more unfavourable thoughts and attitudes, as well as lower intentions to support the legalisation proposal and engage in banned behaviours if legalised in sport. Most importantly, the effects of message direction on attitudes and intentions were greater for participants in the moral (vs. immoral) thought condition. Furthermore, changes in attitudes were consistent with a self-validation process. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85184196386,2430,0,,SPSS

Motion of twenty-six cyclists pedalling on a cycle trainer was captured by a video camera capturing frames from the sagittal plane whilst reflective markers were attached to their lower limb. The marker-tracking method was compared to two established deep learning-based approaches (Microsoft Research Asia-MSRA and OpenPose) to estimate hip, knee and ankle joint angles. Poor to moderate agreement was found for both methods, with OpenPose differing from the criterion by 4–8° for the hip and knee joints.

This study aims to compare the impact of drafting on physical intensity (heart rate [HR]) and perceived intensity (ratings of perceived exertion [RPE]) per drafting position. Eighteen skilled male (n = 9) and female (n = 9) skaters (20.0 ± 4.8 years) skated three trials, in first, second or third position, with consistent average velocity (F2,10 = 2.30, p = 0.15, ηp2 = 0.32). Differences in HR and RPE (Borg CR−10 scale) were compared within-subjects (three positions) using a repeated-measures ANOVA (p < 0.05). Compared to the first position, HR was lower in the second (benefit 3.2%) and third (benefit 4.7%) position and lower in third compared to second position (benefit 1.5%), observed in 10 skaters (F2,28 = 28.9, p < 0.001, ηp2= 0.67).

Twenty-four participants were assigned to one of four arms: sets to failure or non-failure with 8–10 repetition maximum (RM), and sets to failure or non-failure with 15RM. Echocardiographic and blood pressure (BP) data were recorded at baseline and 30 min, 6 h and 24 h post-exercise. In all groups end-systolic circumferential wall stress (cESS), and ratio of transmitral inflow velocities (E/A) were significantly decreased while posterior wall thickness (PWT), global circumferential strain (GCS), GCS strain rate (GCSR), global longitudinal strain rate (GLSR), and stroke volume (SV) were significantly increased for up to 6 h of follow-up. In the 15RM groups, left ventricular (LV) mass and interventricular septal thickness (IVST) were significantly increased, and left atrial (LA) area was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) compared to the 8–10 RM groups. In the 15RM groups, RE decreased global longitudinal strain (GLS) and increased ejection fraction (EF) (p<0.01). After RE, transient cardiac perturbations, the reduction in LA compliance, and the improvement in LV myofibril geometry were volume dependent and influenced more by sets to failure technique. RE increased GCS and reduced the afterload, thus helping to preserve SV and EF. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171669317,2500,0,,"SPSS, GraphPad Prism"

Therefore, this study examined the relationship of the micro-environment of former Swiss junior national team ice hockey players with their performance level in adulthood. With quantitative, retrospective data from n = 106 players born between 1984 and 1994, patterns of four factors club, family, peer, and school were built for early (13–15 years old) and late (16–19 years old) youth. The results revealed four structurally and mainly individually stable clusters for both developmental stages in youth. The cluster of the moderately above-average supported players between 16–19 years old demonstrated above-average values in all factors of the micro-environment and are more likely to reach international playing level in adulthood, whereas the structurally weak supported players are linked to a later regional playing level. These results indicate that simultaneous support across all four factors of the micro-environment in youth (club, family, peers, and school) is important to reach an international playing level, while low support in one or more area reduces the chance thereof. Thus, creating supportive environments across the board should be considered for a successful talent development. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85153187744,2593,1,"Identified using twin-search method, squared euclidean distance, threshold 0.8, above removed.",ROPstat

Moreover, multiple effective coordination strategies may be available to athletes of similar ability, which typical group-based analyses may mask. This study aimed to identify sub-groups of sprinters based on thigh-thigh and shank-foot coordination during initial acceleration, and assess sprint performance across different combinations of coordination strategies. Angular kinematics were obtained from 21 sprinters, and coordination determined using vector coding methods, with step 1 and steps 2–4 separated for analysis. Performance was assessed using metrics derived from velocity-time profiles. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, three distinct coordination strategies were identified from thigh-thigh and shank-foot coordination in step 1 and two strategies in steps 2–4. Coordination strategies primarily differed around early flight thigh-thigh coordination and early stance shank-foot coordination in step 1, while timing of reversals in thigh rotation characterised differences in later steps. Higher performers tended to have greater lead thigh and foot dominance in step 1 and early swing thigh retraction in steps 2–4. The novel application of cluster analysis to coordination provides new insights into initial acceleration technique in sprinters, with potential considerations for training and performance. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181697207,2418,0,,R

Forty-four female and 102 male sprinters performed 60-m sprints, during which the spatiotemporal and GRF variables were obtained using a long force platform system. Female and male sprinters were each allocated into four groups based on their maximal speed (7.5–9.5 m/s and 8.5–10.5 m/s, respectively) with 0.5 m/s intervals, and average values for 50-m distance were calculated. Using the GRF data, normative data for four groups of female and male sprinters were successfully obtained. For female sprinters using average values of all steps, there were differences between performance levels for step frequency (SF) and support time (ST), all impulses, and all mean forces. For male sprinters using average values of all steps, there were differences between performance levels for SF, ST and flight time, all impulses except for braking impulse, and all of the mean forces. The normative data indicate that most of the spatiotemporal and GRF variables may be changed, particularly increasing SF and propulsive force, when sprint performance is improved. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85173786146,2549,0,,

Six elite sit para-biathletes wore a positioning system device during the world-championships in three different competition formats (Sprint, Middle-distance, and Long-distance). Total Skiing Time (TST), penalty-time, shooting-time, and Total Race Time (TRT) were analysed. One-way analyses of variance were used to compare the relative contributions of TST, penalty-time, and shooting-time to TRT across the three race formats. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to determine the course positions (clusters) where instantaneous skiing speed was significantly associated with TST. The contribution of TST to TRT was lower for the Long-distance (80 ± 6%) compared to the Sprint (86 ± 5%) and Middle-distance (86 ± 3%) races, however this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The proportional contribution of penalty-time to TRT was significantly greater (p < 0.05) for the Long-distance (13 ± 6%) compared to the Sprint (5 ± 4%) and Middle-distance (4 ± 3%) races. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) revealed specific clusters where instantaneous skiing speed was significantly associated with TST. For example, over all laps during the Long-distance race, the fastest athlete gained 6.5 s over the slowest athlete in the section with the steepest uphill. Overall, these findings can provide insights into pacing strategies and help para-biathlon coaches and athletes optimise training programmes to improve performance. © 2023 The Author(s).

In addition to this, researchers have also proposed that body image inflexibility can determine mental health and behavioural outcomes. However, research is yet to explore whether and to what extent irrational beliefs and body image inflexibility align to influence mental health and exercise dependence. We examined the latent profile structure of irrational beliefs and body image inflexibility, and how these latent profiles relate to mental health and exercise dependence in exercise active adults. Results indicate a two class profile, whereby class 1 is characterized by high irrational beliefs and body image inflexibility, and class 2 is characterized by low irrational beliefs and body image inflexibility. Those in class 1 reported significantly greater depression, anxiety, stress, and exercise dependence than those in class 2 (p ≤.02).

Eight men who had back squat (BS) 1 repetition maximum (1RM) to body mass ratio; 1.8 ± 0.2 completed 2 BS exercise sessions in a counterbalanced and a randomized order; RR + L: 4 sets of (2 × 5) repetitions with 90-second interset rest and 30-second intraset rest using 75% BS 1RM and traditional sets (TS): 4 sets of 10 repetitions with 120-second interset rest using 70% BS 1RM. Blood samples were collected before exercise, immediately post exercise, and 5, 15, and 30 minutes post exercise for the analysis of growth hormone (GH), total testosterone (TT), cortisol (C), and blood lactate (BL), whereas rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate (HR) were measured immediately after each set of the BS exercise. While neither main effect of condition nor interaction existed, there was a significant (p < 0.05) main effect of time point (and set) for GH, TT, C, BL, RPE, and HR. Volume load was greater for RR + L compared with TS (4,074.9 ± 786.7 kg vs. 3,796.3 ± 714.8 kg). In conclusion, RR + L increases volume load by approximately 7% but does not seem to influence GH (g = -0.15), TT (g = -0.09), BL (g = -0.22), RPE (g = 0.14), and HR (g = -0.08) responses.

Test-retest reliability (noise) and seasonal variability (signal) CMJ data were collected from 13 professional basketball athletes playing for the same club throughout 1 competitive season. Interday reliability (coefficient of variation [CV] and intraclass correlation coefficients) were calculated over 3 preseason tests conducted on 3 consecutive days. To evaluate sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was calculated by dividing seasonal variability (CV) from 8 in-season CMJ tests (collected from November to February) by preseason reliability (CV). Players performed 3 CMJs each testing day, and 3 data analysis techniques were applied: a single variable from the trial with either the best jump height (BestJH;calculated by flight time) or the best flight time to contraction time (BestFT:CT) and mean output across 3 jumps (Mean3). Mean3was the most reliable data analysis technique, with 79 and 82 of 84 variables displaying lower interday CVs compared with BestJHand BestFT:CT, respectively. Overall, many CMJ measures display seasonal changes that are greater than the inherent noise, with 77 variables producing SNR of >1.00 for Mean3compared with 65 and 58 variables for BestJHand BestFT:CT, respectively. To improve reliability and sensitivity, it is recommended that practitioners use the average of multiple CMJ trials and regularly reassess measurement characteristics specific to their cohort and environment. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

There were shorter Δ ground combat activity time (p ≤ 0.05) in 1R × 1ER (23.4 ± 45.5) and 2R × 2ER (25.3 ± 41.9) vs. 2R × 3ER (50.4 ± 69.9) and 3R × 3ER (52.9 ± 74.2), with lower attempted submissions, chokes, and attempted and landed strikes to the head, body, and leg frequencies observed. These results contribute to the information developed from current research to help improve the quality of training and promote effective athletic preparation related to pacing strategy and performance models. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

However, muscle forces and how muscles accelerate the center of mass (CoM) are not well understood. The purpose was to determine how lower extremity muscles contribute to the vertical acceleration of the CoM when squatting to parallel using 85% one-repetition maximum. Thirteen female subjects performed squats in a randomized fashion. Musculoskeletal modeling was used to obtain muscle forces and muscle-induced accelerations. The vasti, soleus, and gluteus maximus generated the largest upward accelerations of the CoM, whereas the muscles that produced the largest downward acceleration about the CoM were the hamstrings, iliopsoas, adductors, and tibialis anterior. Our findings indicate that a muscle's function is task and posture specific. That is, muscle function depends on both joint position and how an individual is interacting with the environment. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

This study examined the relationship between the FROM and PROM 1-repetition maximum (1RM) DL and if the PROM 1RM DL can be estimated by the FROM 1RM DL. Eighteen National Collegiate Athletic Association wrestlers (20.8 ± 1.2 years, 176.0 ± 5.2 cm, 78.9 ± 10.6 kg) performed a warm-up followed by the assessment of the FROM and PROM 1RM DLs. The FROM DLs were executed with a starting position of the bar resting on the lifting platform. Partial range of motion DLs were executed in a power rack with the bar starting position at ≈2.54 cm above the patella. Regression analysis was employed to estimate PROM 1RM DL based on FROM 1RM DL, body height, and mass. A Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to compare the PROM 1RM DL with FROM 1RM DL. A dependent t test was used to compare the PROM 1RM DL and FROM 1RM DL scores (α < 0.05). The PROM 1RM DL scores (226.0 ± 40.6 kg) were significantly greater than the FROM 1RM DL scores (191.7 ± 37.2 kg) (p < 0.05: effect size = 0.92). The PCC between the PROM and FROM 1RM DL was r = 0.85 (p < 0.05). The regression coefficient for the FROM 1RM DL was significant (p < 0.05; R = 0.85, R2= 0.73). The regression coefficients for body mass and height were not significant (p > 0.05). The PROM and FROM DL may be interchangeable modalities within an RT program, and the PROM 1RM DL can be accurately predicted by the FROM 1RM DL. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Effects of static contemporary western yoga vs. a dynamic stretching exercise program on body composition, balance, and flexibility. J Strength Cond Res 37(5): 1064-1069, 2023 - Essentrics is a dynamic full-body stretching workout, which has recently earned its popularity in the field of yoga because of its potential for improvement in balance, flexibility, and weight loss while adding enjoyment to the workout without any discomfort and pain. However, the effects of Essentrics on overall health have not been well studied, particularly in a younger, physically healthy population. Thirty-five subjects (27 females and 8 males, age = 20.4 ± 0.2 years, and body mass index = 22.58 ± 0.55 kg·m-2) were assigned to 2 groups - contemporary western yoga (CWY, n = 20) and Essentrics (ESS, n = 15). Each group met 3 times per week for a total of 45-50 minutes per day for 6 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), flexibility (sit-and-reach), and balance (lower extremity Y-balance) were assessed before and after the 6-week program. The balance test included 3 reaches (anterior, posteromedial [PM], and posterolateral [PL] and composite reach distance). Each reach was averaged for the right and left sides and then normalized to leg length. Data were analyzed using an analysis of variance with repeated measures (p ≤ 0.05), and a post hoc test was performed for any significant interactions. There were no significant group differences between CWY and ESS in balance and flexibility. Following the 6-week yoga programs, balance was improved as follows: PM (87.13 ± 11.64 cm to 92.25 ± 9.91 cm, p = 0.001), PL (82.88 ± 11.28 to 88.62 ± 9.62 cm, p = 0.002), composite reach distance (CRD) (225.96 ± 27.17 to 238.26 ± 22.98 cm, p = 0.001), normalized PM (98.31 ± 11.68 to 104.27 ± 11.14%, p = 0.001), normalized PL (93.60 ± 11.98 to 100.15 ± 10.70%, p = 0.001), and normalized CRD (255.12 ± 27.89 to 269.21 ± 25.07%, p = 0.001). Flexibility was also improved from 51.42 ± 8.24 to 53.38 ± 7.04 cm (p = 0.010) following the 6-week workout programs. Total body fat percentage was significantly reduced only in the CWY group (24.44 ± 6.73 to 23.51 ± 6.32%, p = 0.002). Regardless of the type of stretching workout, both dynamic and static workouts improved flexibility and balance. Thus, individuals seeking to improve balance and flexibility can benefit from either dynamic or static yoga program. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine competition strategies that underpin gold medalists' (GMs) and silver or bronze medalists' (SBMs) performances. Data collected from open-age International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) World Championship events 2013-2019 were analyzed (1,312 competitors [males n = 734, females n = 578]). Attempt weight and success for the squat (SQ), bench press (BP), and deadlift (DL); 'total' competition scores; category (age, weight class, and sex); and placing were categorized into 3 groups: GMs, SBMs, and nonwinners (fourth place or lower). One-way analysis of variances determined between group differences. Odds ratios (ORs) for the likelihood of winning and placing (i.e., GMs or SBMs) were also calculated. The odds of winning a competition were increased 5.9 times for men and by 1.5 times for women, when successfully completing 8 or 9 of 9 lift attempts. These findings provide comprehensive insight into intracompetition-related factors that contribute to World Championship powerlifting success to directly inform coach and athlete strategies. This information may also hold relevance for competitive state or national competitions and extend to other similarly structured strength-based sports. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate body mass and physical fitness test performance changes at a Division 1 program with 28 years of coaching stability. Initial and personal record results were collected from 1,102 players who were subdivided into 3 position groups: combination players (COMBO), skill players (SKILL), and line of scrimmage players. Players followed a linear periodized training program with biannual body mass and performance testing. Tested variables included body mass, strength (bench press, back squat, and front squat), impulse (power clean, push jerk, and vertical jump [VJ]), and speed/agility (10-yard dash [10YD], 40-yard dash, and 20-yard shuttle). The fixed effect of time and position group on the dependent variables was assessed using linear mixed models. If appropriate, post hoc tests using the estimated marginal means were used to evaluate the source of any significant effects. Significance was accepted as p < 0.05. Normative values were produced by descriptive statistics (i.e., weighted means). All players and position groups increased/improved across all tested variables (p < 0.05). Improvements were 8.2%, 11.9-18.3%, 13.5-17.5%, and 3.6-6.0% for body mass, strength, impulse, and speed/agility, respectively. Line of scrimmage improvements were absolutely larger across most tested variables and relatively larger for back squat, VJ, and 10YD vs. SKILL and with VJ vs. COMBO/SKILL (p < 0.05). These results reveal typical expectations for 4-5 years performance improvements and that position group differences in trainability may influence game readiness and training needs. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Data sources included PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), Google Scholar, SPORTDiscuss (EBSCO), Embase (Elsevier), and Thesis Global. Subjects were healthy, active adults who performed either a vertical jump or a linear sprint outcome measurement. All studies were randomized controlled trials where the effects of a bodyweight conditioning activity were compared with a control condition. The control group followed the same course as the experimental group excluding the intervention, with the intervention and outcome measurement carried out in the same session. The intervention was completed before the initiation of the outcome measure testing. Nineteen studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included. There was a small overall effect of 0.30 (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.46, p = 0.0003) in favor of using a bodyweight conditioning activity to improve the outcome of a subsequent vertical jump or linear sprint. Secondary analysis indicated that there was no difference between the vertical jump and sprint subgroup, <5 minutes or 5 minutes and greater between the intervention and outcome measurement subgroup, or whether an intervention with the same movements or different movements was used before the outcome task subgroup. Using bodyweight conditioning activities before performing a maximal vertical jump or sprint may provide a small benefit in performance outcome. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

However, their combined contribution to running performance is unknown. We investigated the association of 2 collagen gene SNPs with athlete status and performance in 1,429 Caucasian subjects, including 597 competitive runners (354 men and 243 women) and 832 nonathletes (490 men and 342 women). Genotyping for COL1A1 rs1800012 (C > A) and COL5A1 rs12722 (C > T) SNPs was performed by a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The numbers of ""injury-resistant"" alleles from each SNP, based on previous literature (rs1800012 A allele and rs12722 C allele), were combined as an injury-resistance score (RScore, 0-4; higher scores indicate injury resistance). Genotype frequencies, individually and combined as an RScore, were compared between cohorts and investigated for associations with performance using official race times. Runners had 1.34 times greater odds of being rs12722 CC homozygotes than nonathletes (19.7% vs. 15.5%, p = 0.020) with no difference in the rs1800012 genotype distribution (p = 0.659). Fewer runners had an RScore 0 of (18.5% vs. 24.7%) and more had an RScore of 4 (0.6% vs. 0.3%) than nonathletes (p < 0.001). Competitive performance was not associated with the COL1A1 genotype (p = 0.933), COL5A1 genotype (p = 0.613), or RScore (p = 0.477). Although not associated directly with running performance among competitive runners, a higher combined frequency of injury-resistant COL1A1 rs1800012 A and COL5A1 rs12722 C alleles in competitive runners than nonathletes suggests these SNPs may be advantageous through a mechanism that supports, but does not directly enhance, running performance. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of adding barbell deadlift or hex-bar deadlift exercises to current warm-up routines on running and jumping performances in football players. Ten highly trained male football players participated in the study during the competitive phase of the season. All players performed 3 protocols in the same week: A standard warm-up that included players' regular routines and 2 other protocols with the addition of barbell or hex-bar deadlift, after the end of the warm-up (3 sets of 3 reps, progressing set by set from 60% to 85% repetition maximum). All protocols had the same time interval between pretest (immediately after the warm-up) and posttest (15 minutes after the warm-up). Vertical jumping (countermovement jump [CMJ]; Abalakov jump [AJ]) and running performances (505 test) were impaired 15 minutes after the standard warm-up (CMJ:-6.7 ± 4.2%; AJ:-8.1 ± 8.4%; and 505 time: 1.4 ± 2.5%). For warm-up with the addition of barbell deadlift, vertical jump increased by 4.3 ± 5.6% (Cohen's dunb: 0.23 [0.02-0.47]) and 505 time decreased by-5.9 ± 3.6% (Cohen's dunb: 0.97 [-1.68 to-0.43]). The warm-up with hex-bar deadlift led to trivial changes for CMJ and AJ, but 505 time decrease by-2.7 ± 2.6% (Cohen's dunb:-0.53 [-1.01 to-0.13]). The deadlift exercise can be added to warm-up routines to maintain or even enhance acute physical performance. However, coaches and practitioners should be aware that performance enhancements resultant from deadlift may vary according to individual physical profiles. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Greater gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy after partial range of motion training performed at long muscle lengths. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1746-1753, 2023-Whether there is an optimal range of motion (ROM) to induce muscle hypertrophy remains elusive, especially for gastrocnemius. This study aimed to compare the changes in gastrocnemius muscle thickness between calf raise exercise performed with full ROM (FULLROM), partial ROM performed in the initial (INITIALROM), and final (FINALROM) portions of the ROM. Forty-Two young women performed a calf training program for 8 weeks, 3 days·week-1, with differences in the calf raise ROM configuration. The calf raise exercise was performed in a pin-loaded, horizontal, leg-press machine, in 3 sets of 15-20 repetition maximum. The supjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: FULLROM(ankle:-25° to +25°), INITIALROM(ankle:-25° to 0°), and FINALROM(ankle: 0° to +25°), where 0° was defined as an angle of 90° of the foot with the tibia. The muscle thickness measurements of medial and lateral gastrocnemius were taken by means of B-mode ultrasound. INITIALROMelicited greater medial gastrocnemius increases than FULLROMand FINALROM(INITIALROM= +15.2% vs. FULLROM= +6.7% and FINALROM= +3.4%; p ≤ 0.009). Furthermore, INITIALROMelicited greater lateral gastrocnemius increases than FINALROM(INITIALROM= +14.9% vs. FINALROM= +6.2%; p < 0.024) but did not significantly differ from FULLROM(FULLROM= +7.3%; p = 0.060). The current results suggest that calf training performed at longer muscle lengths may optimize gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy in young women. Therefore, when prescribing hypertrophy-oriented training, the inclusion of the calf raise exercise performed with partial ROM in the initial portion of the excursion should be considered. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

The effect of external dissociative stimuli on plank duration performed by male collegiate soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 37(5): e341-e345, 2023 - Individuals commonly use music as an external auditory stimulus to divert their attention away from aerobic endurance exercise tasks. Music generally results in lower ratings of perceived exertion, which may be the mechanism by which it increases aerobic exercise task duration. However, less is known regarding how music affects the performance of other forms of exercise, such as isometric exercise. Moreover, the effects of different external stimuli on isometric task duration, such as the use of virtual reality (VR), have yet to be investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of self-selected music (SSM) and VR on isometric exercise task duration using a forearm plank. We hypothesized that both SSM and VR would effectively increase plank duration compared with no external stimuli. Seventeen male collegiate soccer players (19 ± 1 year) completed 3 planks to failure on 3 separate days, with 48-72 hours between the trials. The ordering of each exercise condition (SSM, VR, or None) was randomized for a total of 6 potential orders. A one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate differences in plank duration and average heart rate (HRavg) between each trial, and significance was set at p < 0.05. There were no differences in plank duration (SSM: 200 ± 44, VR: 173 ± 38, None: 177 ± 37 seconds) or HRavg(SSM: 96 ± 18, VR: 92 ± 21, None: 87 ± 18 beats per minute) between the conditions. We conclude that there was no effect of external stimuli (SSM or VR) on isometric exercise task duration and the use of these modalities should be based on exerciser preference. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Aiming to quantify and indicate timing protocols for conditioning coaches when training athletes using PAP. 17 male (25.3 ± 3.6 years old; 179.3 ± 2.3 cm; 78.0 ± 5.2 kg), experienced Muay Thai fighters completed a standardized warm-up, including a 10-minute cycle on the Wattbike at 60 watts and 30 body mass squats for a dynamic stretch. Subjects then completed a baseline test by striking a PowerKube using the roundhouse and Teep kick techniques. PAP exercise consisted of 4 squat repetitions to maximum effort, followed by a rest period of 2, 5, or 8 minutes. Subjects then struck the PowerKube again using the roundhouse and Teep kick techniques. Rest periods were presented in a randomized order on separate days, with 72 hours between conditions. The level of significance was set at α = 0.05. Significant increases in both roundhouse (χ2(3) = 38.51, p < 0.05) and Teep kick (χ2(3) = 26.33, p < 0.05) striking power were observed when compared with baseline. For the roundhouse kick, significant differences and large effect sizes were present between all conditions except baseline and 2-minute rest. For the Teep kick, significant differences and large effect sizes were present between baseline and 5-minute rest and baseline and 8-minute rest. This indicates that PAP with 5- or 8-minute rest increased roundhouse and Teep kick power. This research reports that a PAP stimulus from a 4RM squat exercise, followed by a 5- or 8-minute rest period, enhances kick power in trained Muay Thai fighters. This technique provides a readily available, time-efficient method to enhance performance that can be built into the warm-up procedure of athletes before training or competition. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

Comparison of sprint timing methods on performance, and displacement and velocity at timing initiation. J Strength Cond Res 37(1): 234-238, 2023-Sprint testing is commonly used to assess speed and acceleration in athletes. However, vastly different outcomes have been reported throughout the literature. These differences are likely due to the sprint timing method rather than differences in athlete ability. Consequently, this study compared different sprint starting methods on sprint time and quantified the velocity and displacement of the athlete at the moment timing is initiated. Starting in a staggered 2-point stance, 12 team sport athletes were required to accelerate 10 meters for 10 repetitions. During each repetition, 5 independent timing methods were triggered. The methods were (a) triggering a Move sensor; (b) starting 50 cm behind the line; (c) triggering a front-foot switch; (d) triggering a rear-foot switch; and (e) starting with the front foot on the line. Timing for each method was initiated at different points during the acceleration phase, and the displacement and velocity of the centroid of the pelvis at the point of timing initiation was assessed under high-speed motion capture. The Move sensor had the smallest displacement and lowest velocity at the point of timing initiation, whereas the front-foot trigger demonstrated the largest displacement and highest velocities. Trivial to very large effect size differences were observed between all methods in displacement and velocity at the point of timing initiation. Furthermore, small to very large differences in time to 5 m were found. These findings emphasize that sprint outcomes should not be compared, unless starting methods are identical. In addition, to detect real change in performance, consistent standardized protocols should be implemented.  © 2022 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144130234,2910,0,,R

J Strength Cond Res 37(6): 1218-1224, 2023 - Sports movement correction is one of the major problems for motor control and learning. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine which of the 3 strategies, i.e., the self-observation method with direct instructions (SO-DI), self-observation alone (SO), or the direct instruction (DI), would be useful for correcting errors during the snatch technique. Forty-eight children with 2 months of experience were randomly assigned to one of 4 training conditions: SO-DI, SO, DI, or control. In this study, the experience lasted 15 sessions. Subjects completed the test sessions before (T0) and after (T1) 12 training sessions and a retention test session after 2 weeks (T2). The Kinovea version 0.8.15 software was used to measure the kinematic parameters of weightlifting performance. After the training intervention, the data showed that the SO-DI group registered a greater improvement in all kinematic parameters compared with the SO, DI, and control groups, and this benefit was present 2 weeks later in the retention test (e.g., the horizontal displacement of the bar in the first pull with respect to the starting position [T1 vs. T0: +32.57 ± 6.69%, d = 1.87, p < 0.001; T2 vs. T0: 25.07 ± 11.55%, d = 1.32, p < 0.001] and the horizontal displacement of the bar between the receiving position and the reference line [T1 vs. T0: 24.34 ± 29%, d = 1.17, p < 0.01; T2 vs. T0: 25.53 ± 30.4%, d = 0.99, p < 0.01]).

The acute effect of high-intensity resistance training on subsequent firefighter performance. J Strength Cond Res 37(7): 1507-1514, 2023-High-intensity resistance training (HIRT) is commonly performed by structural firefighters on duty to enhance occupational readiness. However, exercise-induced fatigue may negatively impact subsequent occupational performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the acute effect of HIRT on subsequent occupational physical ability in structural firefighters and to determine the time course of recovery. Seven resistance-trained male firefighters performed a timed maximal effort simulated fireground test (SFGT) in 3 randomized conditions: baseline (SFGTbaseline), 10 minutes post HIRT (SFGT10min), and 60 minutes post HIRT (SFGT60min). Work efficiency and air depletion were assessed during the SFGT. The timed HIRT session consisted of a standardized set of exercises using absolute training loads. Repeated measures analysis of variance and minimal difference (MD) analysis assessed group and individual effects between the conditions, respectively. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. SFGT10mincompletion time was greater than SFGTbaseline(430 ± 137 vs. 297 ± 69 seconds, p < 0.01), with no difference between SFGTbaselineand SFGT60min(297 ± 69 vs. 326 ± 89 seconds, p = 0.08). The MD analysis indicated that all firefighters' SFGT10mintimes exceeded the MD (±26.4 seconds) compared with SFGTbaseline. However, 43% of firefighters still exceeded the MD at SFGT60min. Air depletion during SFGT10minwas greater than that during SFGTbaseline(2,786 ± 488 vs. 2,186 ± 276 lb·in-2, p = 0.02), with no difference between SFGTbaselineand SFGT60min(p = 0.25). Work efficiency during SFGT10minwas 40% lower than that during SFGTbaseline(p < 0.01), with no difference between SFGTbaselineand SFGT60min(p = 0.25). These findings indicate that an acute bout of HIRT decreases multiple descriptors of firefighters' occupational performance 10 minutes post exercise with varied responses at 60 minutes post exercise. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

In addition, according to the six-letter system classification, the authors analyzed a potential association between the area affected by BMLs and the specific type of joint lesion. Methods: The authors screened all the knee MRIs performed in the investigation center between 2017 and 2018 to identify the presence of BMLs. The lesions were then categorized following the “six-letter system”. The authors searched the presence of associated meniscal, chondral or ligamentous lesions. Finally, the authors researched a correlation between the lesion type described by the six-letter system classification and the associated lesions. Results: MRI exams of 4000 patients were studied, identifying 666 BMLs. The associated lesions were collected for all patients, resulting in an overall prevalence of related lesions in almost 90% of patients. The authors found a statistical significance for type TLD (Tibia-Lateral-Articular) and ACL rupture. The study suggests a strong positive correlation between type E (Edge) and meniscal fracture or extrusion. Conclusion: BMLs in the knee are associated in 90% of cases with a radiological sign of related injury to the joint structures. The six-letter system of BMLs type TLD can be considered a sign of ACL rupture and type E as a high suspicious sign for meniscal extrusion. Those very typical BML patterns can help the clinician in the diagnosis of ACL tears and meniscal extrusion. Furthermore, the presence of a BML must be, for the clinician, a high suspicious sign of joint-related injuries.

Methods: This systematic review was performed to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs that compared the outcomes of patients who did and did not receive suprascapular nerve release (SSNR) during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant studies. Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) was used for cohort study assessment. The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (version 1.0) was used to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials. The primary outcomes were pain and shoulder function. The secondary outcome was the re-tear rate. Results: Two RCTs and three non-RCTs with a total of 187 patients (90 patients received SSNR and 97 patients did not receive SSNR) were included in this systematic review. The meta-analysis revealed that the SSNR group did not had a more pain reduction, assessed by visual analogue scale, compared to the non-SSNR group. Also, the SSNR group did not have a significantly more improvement in the UCLA score, compared to the non-SSNR group. In addition, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of Constant score and re-tear rate. Conclusions: The result of this study showed that additional suprascapular nerve release did not provide additional benefit in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery.

This study aimed to assess the lateral ligaments and their relationships through a 3D view achieved by digitally marking their footprints. Methods: Eleven fresh-frozen ankle specimens were dissected. The calcaneus, talus and fibula were separated, maintaining the lateral ligament footprints. Subsequently, each bone was assessed by a light scanner machine. Finally, all the scans were converted to 3D polygonal models. The footprint areas of the talus, calcaneus and fibula were selected, analysed and the surface area was quantified in cm2. Results: After scanning the bones, the anterior talofibular ligament inferior fascicle (ATFLif), calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL) footprints were continuous at the medial side of the fibula, corresponding to a continuous footprint with a mean area of 4.8 cm2 (± 0.7). The anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) footprint on the talus consisted of 2 parts in 9 of the 11 feet, whilst there was a continuous insertion in the other 2 feet. The CFL insertion on the calcaneus was one single footprint in all cases. Conclusion: The tridimensional analysis of the lateral ligaments of the ankle demonstrates that the ATFLif, CFL and PTFL have a continuous footprint at the medial side of the fibula in all analysed specimens. These data can assist the surgeon in interpreting the ligament injuries, improving the imaging assessment and guiding the surgeon to repair and reconstruct the ligaments in an anatomical position. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169596459,3040,0,,SPSS

It is indicated in cases of severe varus or valgus deformities where a single-level osteotomy would yield significantly tilted joint line obliquity (JLO). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of DLO in achieving accurate correction without compromising JLO, using patient-specific cutting guides (PSCGs), in cases of bifocal valgus maligned knees. Methods: A single-centre, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for a total of 26 patients, who underwent DLO by PSCGs for valgus malaligned knees, between 2015 and 2020. Post-operative alignment was evaluated and the delta for different lower limb0.05, not statistically significant (ns)). All KOOS subs alignment parameters was calculated; the hip-knee-ankle angle (ΔHKA), medial proximal tibial angle (ΔMPTA), and lateral distal femoral angle (ΔLDFA). At the two-year follow-up, changes in the KOOS sub-scores, UCLA scores, lower limb discrepancy (LLD), and mean time to return to work and sport were recorded. All intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. The Mann–Whitney U test with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to evaluate the differences between two variables; one-way ANOVA between more than two variables and the paired Student's t-test was used to estimate the evolution of functional outcomes. Results: The postoperative mean ΔHKA was 0.9 ± 0.9°, the mean ΔMPTA was 0.7 ± 0.7°, and the mean ΔLDFA was 0.7 ± 0.8° (all values with p > 0.05, not statistically significant (ns)). All KOOS subscore's mean values were improved to an extent two-fold superior to the reported minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (all with p < 0.0001). There was a significant increase in the UCLA score at the final follow-up (5.4 ± 1.5 preoperatively versus 7.7 ± 1.4, p < 0.01). The mean time to return to sport and work was 4.7 ± 1.1 and 4.3 ± 2.1 months, respectively. There was an improvement in Lower-limb discrepancy preoperative (LLD = 1.3 ± 2 cm) to postoperative measures (LLD = 0.3 ± 0.4 cm), ns. Complications were 2 femoral hinge fractures, 2 deep vein thromboses, 1 delayed tibial healing, and 1 hardware removal for hamstring irritation syndrome. Conclusion: DLO is effective and safe in achieving accurate correction in bifocal valgus malaligned knees with maintained lower limb length and low complication rate with no compromise of JLO.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 517 knees following robotic-arm assisted medial UKA was conducted. Postoperative mechanical hip-knee-ankle angle (mHKA) was compared to estimated pre-arthritic coronal alignment, using the arithmetic hip-knee-ankle angle (aHKA). Knees were considered restored to the pre-arthritic coronal alignment if mHKA was within 2.0° of aHKA (Group 1). Non-restored knees were subdivided into > 2.0° over correction (Group 2), or > 2.0° under correction (Group 3) from the pre-arthritic coronal alignment. Patellar congruence and patellar tilt angles were compared between groups. The Kujala score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritic Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR) were analyzed by group. Continuous data was compared using analysis of variance or Kruskal–Wallis tests. Chi-squared tests were used to compare discrete variables. Logistic regressions were conducted to estimate the probability of postoperative patellofemoral malalignment. Results: Group 1 included 357 knees (69.1%), Group 2 included 57 knees (11.0%), and Group 3 included 57 knees (11.0%). The prevalence of postoperative abnormal patellar congruence (i.e. ≥ 17°) was higher in Group 3 at 40.4% (p = 0.009), with a higher odds ratio of having an abnormal patellar congruence angle (2.3, p = 0.01) compared to Group 1. The prevalence of postoperative abnormal patellar tilt (i.e. ≥ 14°) was comparable between groups (n.s.). At mean follow up of 4.4 ± 1.6 years, Kujala was worse in Group 3 (76.6 ± 17.4 compared to 84.0 ± 14.9 and 85.0 ± 14.4 in Groups 1 and 2, respectively; p = 0.006). Mean KOOS, JR outcomes were comparable among groups. No significantly inferior Kujala or KOOS, JR outcomes were observed in patients across all groups with abnormal patellar congruence or tilt angles. Conclusion: Knees with under correction from their pre-arthritic coronal alignment following medial UKA were associated with a two-fold higher probability of having postoperative patellofemoral incongruence, as well as inferior mid-term Kujala scores compared to knees with restored pre-arthritic coronal alignment and knees with overcorrection from their pre-arthritic coronal alignment. Patellofemoral incongruence alone did not negatively impact functional outcome scores.

Methods: This study prospectively randomised 72 total knee arthroplasties to a 2-week (from day 0) intervention of GR treatment (n = 36, 63.9% females) or UC of ice with static compression (n = 36, 45.7% females). Knee flexion and extension range of motion (ROM), a visual analogue pain scale and limb circumference were documented at day 1, 2 and 14, as well as 6 weeks post-surgery. Medication usage and length of hospital stay were documented. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and a Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. Statistical analysis using linear mixed modelling and analysis of variance table with Satterthwaite's method were used along with two-tailed t-tests. Results: There were no significant group-by-time interactions regarding any of the outcomes. The GR group had 19% lost to follow-up at 2 weeks, while the UC group had 8%. The GR group demonstrated significantly better knee extension ROM at day 1 (p = 0.048) and day 14 (p = 0.007) compared with the UC group. There were no group differences (n.s.) observed in pain, flexion ROM, limb circumference, opioid use or PROMs. Overall, higher pain levels resulted in increased opioid intake (p = 0.002), older patients used significantly less opioids (p < 0.001) and males reported significantly less pain than females (p = 0.048). No adverse effects were observed due to either protocol. Conclusion: Despite patients gaining significantly more knee extension during the initial two-week intervention period when using GR compared to UC, this effect was likely due to chance. No further significant differences were observed between the groups during or after cession of the intervention.

Methods: Data were obtained from the Swedish National Knee Ligament Registry. Two study groups were created: (1) index ACL reconstruction (ACL group) and (2) index PCL reconstruction (PCL group). Between-group differences were investigated using Fisher’s exact test and Fisher’s non-parametric permutation test for dichotomous variables and continuous variables, respectively. Results: Of 39,010 patients, 38,904 were ACL injuries. A larger proportion of patients with combined injuries to the PCL, meniscus and cartilage were female, aged > 25 years and with a BMI of > 35 kg/m2 compared with patients with combined injuries to the ACL, meniscus and cartilage. An isolated ACL injury was more commonly found in males, while all other injury profiles of ACL, including combined injuries with meniscus, cartilage and collateral ligament injuries, were more frequently observed in females. The PCL injuries were sustained either during pivoting sports, non-pivoting sports or were traffic-related. Conclusion: Different patient characteristics (BMI, age and sex), and activities at the time of injury (sport- versus traffic-related activities), resulted in distinct injury profiles for the ACL and PCL groups. These findings provide valuable information of the way specific injury patterns of cruciate ligament injuries occur, and subsequently may help clinicians with the diagnostic process of ACL and PCL injuries.

Methods: Long-leg radiographs of 95 patients with varus malalignment that underwent medial open-wedge HTO were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Three investigators and an AI software using deep learning algorithms (LAMA™, ImageBiopsy Lab, Vienna, Austria) evaluated the hip–knee–ankle angle (HKA), mechanical axis deviation (MAD), joint line convergence angle (JLCA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA), and mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA). All measurements were performed twice and the performance of the AI software was compared with individual human readers using a Bayesian mixed model. In addition, the inter-observer intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-observer reliability was evaluated by comparing measurements from manual readers. The intra-reader variability for manual measurements and the AI-based software was evaluated using the intra-observer ICC. Results: Initial varus malalignment was corrected to slight valgus alignment after HTO. Measured by the AI algorithm and manually HKA (5.36° ± 3.03° and 5.47° ± 2.90° to − 0.70 ± 2.34 and − 0.54 ± 2.31), MAD (19.38 mm ± 11.39 mm and 20.17 mm ± 10.99 mm to − 2.68 ± 8.75 and − 2.10 ± 8.61) and MPTA (86.29° ± 2.42° and 86.08° ± 2.34° to 91.6 ± 3.0 and 91.81 ± 2.54) changed significantly from pre- to postoperative, while JLCA and mLDFA were not altered. The fully automated AI-based analyses showed no significant differences for all measurements compared with manual reads neither in native preoperative radiographs nor postoperatively after HTO. Mean absolute differences between the AI-based software and mean manual observer measurements were 0.5° or less for all measurements. Inter-observer ICCs for manual measurements were good to excellent for all measurements, except for JLCA, which showed moderate inter-observer ICCs. Intra-observer ICCs for manual measurements were excellent for all measurements, except for JLCA and for MPTA postoperatively. For the AI-aided analyses, repeated measurements showed entirely consistent results for all measurements with an intra-observer ICC of 1.0. Conclusions: The AI-based software can provide fully automated analyses of native long-leg radiographs in patients with varus malalignment and after HTO with great accuracy and reproducibility and could support clinical workflows.

Methods: Patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction using hamstring autografts were enrolled. Quadriceps strength, hamstring strength, and anterior tibial translation were measured, and the limb symmetry index (LSI) of the quadriceps and the hamstrings was calculated preoperatively and one year after surgery. Patients were classified into two groups according to the LSI of the quadriceps strength at one year postoperatively (≥ 80% or < 80%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the independent predictors of quadriceps strength recovery, and the cut-off value was calculated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. A model assessing predictive ability of the combination of independent predictors was created, and the area under the curve (AUC) for each independent predictor was calculated by using the receiver-operating characteristic curves and the DeLong method. Results: Of the 646 patients, 414 (64.1%) had an LSI of at least 80% for quadriceps strength one year after surgery, and 232 patients (35.9%) had an LSI of < 80%. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), preinjury sport level, and LSI of preoperative quadriceps strength were independently associated with quadriceps strength recovery one year after ACL reconstruction. The cut-off values were age: 22.5 years; sex: female; BMI: 24.3 kg/m2; preinjury sport level: no sport; and LSI of preoperative quadriceps strength: 63.3%. The AUC of the model assessing the predictive ability of the combination of age, sex, BMI, preinjury sport level, and LSI of preoperative quadriceps strength was significantly higher (0.73) than that of similar factors of preoperative quadriceps strength (AUC: 0.63, 0.53, 0.56, 0.61, and 0.68, p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: The combination of age, sex, BMI, preinjury sport level, and LSI of preoperative quadriceps strength had a superior predictive ability for quadriceps strength recovery at one year after ACL reconstruction than these predictors alone. Multiple factors, including patient characteristics and preoperative quadriceps strength, should be considered when planning rehabilitation programs to improve quadriceps strength recovery after ACL reconstruction.

Mononucleated cell count and CFU-F assay were performed, together with phenotype characterization of BMSCs from iliac crest and proximal tibia, the study of chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity, histological staining and spectrophotometric quantification, and the analysis of mRNAs expression. Results: Cells derived from iliac crest and proximal tibia showed the same phenotypic pattern at flow cytometry, as well as similar chondrogenic and osteogenic potential. However, a significantly higher number of mononuclear cells per ml was observed in younger patients (3.8 ± 1.8 × 107) compared to older patients (1.2 ± 0.8 × 107) (p < 0.0005). The latter yield, obtained from the iliac crest, was significantly higher than resulting from the BMAC harvested from the proximal tibia in the same group of patients (0.3 ± 0.2 × 107, p < 0.0005). This result was confirmed by the CFU-F analysis at day 10 (15.9 ± 19.4 vs 0.6 ± 1.0, p = 0.001) and day-20 (21.7 ± 23.0 vs 2.9 ± 4.2, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Harvest site and age can affect the quality of BMAC. BMSCs obtained from iliac crest and proximal tibia present comparable mesenchymal markers expression as well as osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential, but iliac crest BMAC presents a four times higher number of mononucleated cells with significantly higher clonogenic capacity compared to the tibia. BMAC of younger patients also had a three-time higher number of mononucleated cells. The identification of BMAC characteristics could help to optimize its preparation and to identify the most suitable indications for this orthobiologic treatment in the clinical practice. © 2022, The Author(s).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138769775,3302,0,,SPSS

To prevent this outcome, valgus deformities have been historically treated using more constrained implants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of treating a moderate valgus deformity by combining a surgical technique used to release the postero-lateral soft tissue envelope with the use of a medially congruent (MC) TKA design without using classical, semi-constrained inserts. Methods: Seventy-nine MC TKAs were performed by three surgeons at three institutions between 2016 and 2018 as part of a multicenter, international study. Inclusion criteria were: radiographic late-stage osteoarthritic knees with Ranawat’s type 1 or 2 classification of valgus deformity and integrity of the medial capsular–ligament complex (less than 10 mm of medial opening during valgus stress test at 10° of knee flexion). Exclusion criteria were: BMI > 40; neuromuscular, metabolic, or immunologic disorders; or the inability to complete outcome measures or radiographic assessment. Results: Seventy-seven patients (79 knees), 59 males and 18 females, were evaluated at 2-year minimum follow-up according to the Knee Society Score (KSS) and Forgotten Joint Score (FJS). Mean age at surgery was 70 years (range 48–91). The mean range of motion (ROM) improved from 110° (range 85°–130°) preoperatively to 121° (range 105°–135°) (p < 0.001) at the time of the last follow-up. Preoperative knee extension significantly improved from 3° (range − 15° to 20°) to 1° (range − 5° to 5°) of flexion at the last follow-up in all the patients. KSS and KSS Functional scores were 89 (range 65–100) and 82 points (range 55–100), respectively. The FJS obtained at the last follow-up was 72 (range 49–88). Two patients (2.5%) had major postoperative complications (one periprosthetic joint infection; one postoperative patellar fracture) requiring surgical interventions. Conclusions: In different surgeon’s hands, the use of a modern medially congruent TKA design yielded good clinical outcomes at 2 years in a consecutive series of TKA in valgus arthritic knees. Postoperative instability was not recorded in this series and this finding was related to the high conformity design of the MC polyethylene insert, which significantly differs from classical posterior-stabilized (PS) designs.

Methods: Patients who underwent ASCR between March 2015 and September 2020 with complete preoperative and postoperative 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were retrospectively analysed. Threshold values for MCID, substantial clinical benefit, and PASS were obtained from the previous literature for the PROMs. The time required to achieve clinically significant outcomes was calculated using Kaplan–Meier analysis. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the variables predictive of an earlier or delayed achievement of MCID. Results: Fifty-nine patients with a mean age of 64.5 ± 8.7 years old were included. The time of mean achievement of MCID, substantial clinical benefit, and PASS for VAS was 11.2 ± 0.9, 16.3 ± 1.1, and 16.6 ± 0.9 months, respectively. The time of mean achievement of MCID, substantial clinical benefit, and PASS for ASES was 13.2 ± 1.0, 16.8 ± 1.0, and 18.3 ± 0.9 months, respectively. The time of mean achievement of MCID, substantial clinical benefit, and PASS for the Constant score was 11.6 ± 0.9, 15.1 ± 1.0, and 14.7 ± 0.9 months, respectively. The time of mean achievement of MCID, substantial clinical benefit, and PASS for SANE was 14.4 ± 1.0, 16.1 ± 1.0, and 15.5 ± 0.8 months, respectively. Patients with a higher preoperative VAS score achieved an earlier MCID for VAS (P = 0.014). However, patients with a higher preoperative ASES and SANE scores achieved delayed MCID for ASES and SANE (P = 0.026, and P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Most patients achieved MCIDs around 1 year after arthroscopic superior capsular reconstruction. A higher preoperative VAS score favours faster MCID achievement, while higher preoperative ASES and SANE scores contribute to delayed MCID achievement.

There is a paucity of objective clinical data to identify patients with hip microinstability and guide surgical treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify the degree of distractibility in patients with and without microinstability undergoing hip arthroscopy. Methods: A single-surgeon series of hip arthroscopies were retrospectively reviewed from 2014–2020. All procedures were performed with paralysis on a fracture table with a perineal post where 1 turn of fine traction equates to 4 mm of axial traction. Diagnosis was recorded as isolated instability, instability plus femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and isolated FAI. Operative reports were reviewed to collect patient demographic data, number of turns of traction required for adequate distraction of the femoral head relative to the acetabulum (10 mm), and the presence of residual subluxation after initial traction was released. Results: A total of 464 patients were identified, 26 (5.6%) with isolated microinstability, 183 (39.4%) with microinstability with FAI anatomy, and 255 (55.0%) with FAI. The concurrent diagnosis of microinstability was associated with decreased turns required to adequately distract the hip. Isolated microinstability patients required 6.9 turns (IQR 4.6–8.8) while those with instability plus FAI required 8.8 turns (IQR 6.5–11) and isolated FAI required 19.1 turns (IQR 15–22). Residual subluxation after removal of negative intra-articular pressure but before performing the hip arthroscopy was more commonly associated with instability, occurring in 84.6% of isolated instability and 86.9% of instability plus FAI as compared with 29.8% in the isolated FAI cohort. Conclusion: A diagnosis of hip microinstability, with or without features of FAI, is associated with decreased axial traction required to distract the hip. These data support the use of intra-operative ease of distraction as a method of identifying patients with hip microinstability.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a combination of image-based robotic assistance and the use of modern alignment strategies on the resulting joint line obliquity as well as femoral component rotation and to compare this between varus, neutral and valgus knees. Methods: This retrospective study included 200 patients who received a robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (MAKO®, Stryker) using functional alignment between 2018 and 2020. The patients were divided into a varus (103 patients), neutral (57 patients) and valgus (40 patients) group. The intraoperatively recorded bone cuts and resulting joint line obliquity were identified and compared to values obtained with a robotic computer simulation of kinematic alignment. Results: The mean femoral coronal alignment of the varus, neutral and valgus group, respectively, equalled 0.5° (± 1.1°), 1.1° (± 0.8°) and 1.6° (± 0.7°) of valgus with functional alignment and 2.1° (± 2.1°), 4.1° (± 1.7°) and 6.2° (± 1.7°) of valgus with kinematic alignment. The mean femoral axial alignment of the valgus group resulted in 0.8° (± 2.0°) of internal rotation with functional alignment and 3.9° (± 2.8°) of internal rotation with kinematic alignment. Overall, 186 knees (93%) could be balanced while respecting certain safe zones by using functional alignment as opposed to 54 knees (27% and none in the valgus group) when applying kinematic alignment. Kinematic alignment led to a combination of femoral component valgus and internal rotation of more than 3° in 22 valgus knees (55%), 10 neutral knees (18%) and 3 varus knees (3%) compared to none in each group when applying functional alignment with safe zones. Conclusions: Robotic-assisted kinematic alignment leads to a combination of excessive valgus and internal rotation of the femoral component in valgus and to a lesser extent also in neutral knees when compared with functional alignment.

Methods: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, studies between 2012 and April 2022, on patients 18–60 years old who have had a unicompartmental knee replacement evaluating patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs), were included. The Knee Society Scores (KSS) clinical score was considered the primary outcome. Pre- and post-operative range of motion (ROM), PROMs, complications and survival were recorded. Paired sample t testing was performed to compare the pre-operative with post-operative KSS. Results: Seventeen articles comprising 2083 unicompartmental arthroplasties were included. The follow-up range was between 1 and 15 years. In eligible studies, all reported outcomes were improved following UKA. The mean KSS clinical was significantly improved from 45.5 (SD: 9.6) pre-operatively to 89.4 (SD: 4.4) post-operatively (p = 0.0001). Mean implant survival ranged 86–96.5% at 10 years follow-up. There was no significant difference between mobile and fixed bearing in terms of ROM and KSS clinical. In total, 92 revisions and 7 re-operations with implant retention were reported. Conclusion: Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty for medial osteoarthritis is a safe, reliable and effective treatment option for patients of 60 years or younger.

Methods: A cohort of 302 Japanese adolescent male soccer players aged 12–13 years were followed over 6 months. All players underwent physical examination, tibial tubercle ultrasonography, anthropometric and whole-body composition measurements, and muscle flexibility test of the support leg at the baseline. The developmental stage was evaluated from the PHV age. The OSD of the support leg was diagnosed 6 months later; players were divided into the OSD and control (CON) groups. The predictive risk factors were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: There were 42 players who had developed OSD at baseline and they were excluded from the study. Among the 209 players, 43 and 166 belonged to the OSD and CON groups, respectively. The predictive risk factors of OSD development were PHV age ± 6 months at baseline (p = 0.046), apophyseal stage of tibial tuberosity maturity at baseline (p < 0.001), quadriceps flexibility ≥ 35° at baseline (p = 0.017), and decrease in gastrocnemius flexibility in 6 months (p = 0.009). Conclusion: PHV age ± 6 months at baseline, apophyseal stage of the tibial tuberosity at baseline, quadriceps flexibility ≥ 35° at baseline, and decrease in gastrocnemius flexibility in 6 months are predictive risk factors of OSD development in the support leg among adolescent male soccer players. It is crucial to know the PHV age of each player, and not only the flexibility of quadriceps muscle but also the gastrocnemius should be monitored to predict OSD.

The purposes of this study were to determine whether baseplate migration at 1 year (1) was significantly less than a stability limit of 0.5 mm, (2) increased over time, and (3) was related to varus alignment of the baseplate and limb after unrestricted KA TKA. Methods: Thirty-five patients underwent unrestricted KA TKA using a fixed-bearing, cemented, medial conforming tibial insert with posterior cruciate ligament retention. Using model-based radiostereometric analysis, maximum total point motion (MTPM) (i.e., largest displacement on the baseplate) was computed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively relative to the day of surgery. Baseplate and limb alignment were measured postoperatively on long-leg CT scanograms. Results: At 1 year, mean MTPM of 0.35 mm was significantly less than the 0.5 mm stability limit (p = 0.0002). Mean MTPM did not increase from 6 weeks to 1 year (p = 0.3047). Notably, 89% (31/35) of tibial baseplates and 46% (16/35) of limbs were > 3° varus. Baseplate and limb alignment had no relationship to MTPM at 1 year (|r|≤ 0.173, p ≥ 0.3276). Conclusion: Low and non-progressive tibial baseplate migration 1 year after unrestricted KA TKA with a medial conforming design should allay any concern that unrestricted KA TKA increases risk of baseplate loosening due to varus alignment of the baseplate and limb.

Conclusion: This study can help the surgeons to perform a fast pre-operative planning of an ACL reconstruction for graft selection. If the planned graft with ST and GT is smaller than 8 mm, the clinician can decide to switch to a different type of graft or plan a different graft preparing technique and, therefore, reduce the risk of post-operative ligament re-rupture. The method proposed is reliable and reproducible. The major strength of the planning technique proposed is that it relies on data that are already available for the clinician before surgery, without the need of further analysis.

It was hypothesized that the joint gap produced by manual stress is not reproducible depending on the surgeon’s experience, and the distraction force applied by manual stress throughout the ROM is not constant. Methods: Medial and lateral joint gaps were obtained throughout the ROM by manual stress or a tensioner by two surgeons with different levels of experience in robotic-assisted TKA. The association between the differences in gap measurement by the two surgeons and the preoperative radiographic parameters, including the hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle and absolute and relative varus/valgus laxities were analyzed. Results: The experienced surgeon produced significantly greater gaps than the inexperienced surgeon from 0° to 100° flexion, with a mean difference of 0.35 ± 0.12 mm in the medial gap (p < 0.0001), and from 10° to 120° flexion with a mean difference of 0.57 ± 0.13 mm in the lateral gap (p < 0.0001). The tensioner produced a significantly greater medial gap from 70° to 110° flexion with a mean difference of 0.32 ± 0.01 mm in the medial gap (p < 0.0001) and from 0° to 110° flexion with a mean difference of 1.12 ± 0.26 mm in the lateral gap (p < 0.0001). The differences in gap distance by manual stress between experienced and inexperienced surgeons were moderately correlated with the HKA angle in the lateral gap (r = 0.40, p = 0.01). The gap differences due to manual stress and a tensioner showed moderate negative correlation with the HKA angle in the medial gap (r = − 0.50, p = 0.001) and weak negative correlation with the absolute valgus laxity in the lateral gap (r = − 0.35, p = 0.03). Conclusions: The joint distraction force by manual stress may differ depending on the surgeon’s experience and tended to be smaller in deep flexion; therefore, the flexion gap may be underestimated. Surgeons should determine implant positioning considering gap balance by manual stress, taking into account these characteristics of the manual stress maneuver.

Methods: Two-hundred and sixteen patients who underwent shoulder surgery at one institution were studied. Patients completed both preoperative and 2-year follow-up questionnaires including PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) computer-adaptive testing in six domains, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, shoulder numeric pain scale (NPS), and the Marx Shoulder Activity Rating Scale (MARS). PE were measured using the Musculoskeletal Outcomes and Data Evaluation Management System (MODEMS) expectations domain, and satisfaction was measured via the Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8). Results: The mean PE score was 86.2 ± 17.8. Greater PE were associated with significantly better 2-year scores for ASES, NPS, MARS, SSQ8, and PROMIS domains of Physical Function, Fatigue, Pain Interference Fatigue and Social Satisfaction. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that greater PE were an independent predictor of both better 2-year scores and greater improvement for PROMIS SS (p < 0.001), ASES (p = 0.007), and shoulder NPS (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Greater PE are positively associated with numerous patient-based outcomes 2 years after surgery. With regards to pain relief, shoulder function, and social satisfaction, higher PE are also predictive of better outcome scores and more improvement. This study suggests that preoperative assessment of shoulder surgery PE is important, and that counseling patients to optimize realistic expectations may lead to superior outcomes.

The main objective of our study was to determine whether a systematic alignment (mechanical, anatomical or kinematic) makes it possible to stabilise the operated joint in extension and in flexion. Methods: This monocentric prospective cohort study was conducted between May 1st, 2021 and October 31st, 2021. A total of 132 consecutive patients undergoing primary navigated total knee arthroplasty were included, with a mean age of 72.4 years (7.9; 48.8–91.2 years), a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m2 (4.6; 17.6–41.6) and 71.2% (94/132) women. Mechanical, anatomical and kinematic knee alignments were simulated using Kick software for each patient. The primary outcome was the targeted rate of balanced knees for each type of alignment, based on a three-point score, aiming for a 3/3 score for each knee. Our secondary outcome was to characterise the specific implantation finally achieved by the surgeon. Results: The targeted balance was reached in 10.6% (14/132), 10.6% (14/132) and 12.9% (17/132) of knees with mechanical, anatomical and kinematic alignment simulations, respectively. None of these simulations provided a superior number of balanced knees (p = 0.87). When simulating a patient-specific implantation, the highest score was reached in 89.1% (115/132) of cases. Conclusion: Systematic alignment simulations achieved knee balance in only 11% of cases. Patient-specific implantation, favouring knee balancing over alignment, allowed an 89% perfect score rate without having to perform any collateral release. Level of evidence: Case series.

It was hypothesized that D-DFO would lead to a good functional and radiological outcome, and that both torsional and coronal malalignment could be normalized. Methods: Patients that underwent D-DFO between 06/2011 and 12/2018 for high-grade PFI with an increased FA (> 20°) were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] for pain, Kujala score, Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee subjective knee form [IKDC], and Tegner Activity Scale [TAS]) were evaluated pre- and minimum 24 months postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower extremity and weight-bearing whole-leg anteroposterior radiographs were conducted pre- and postoperatively. The change in FA, coronal limb alignment, and PROMs were tested for statistical significance. Results: In total, 27 patients (30 knees) were included. The D-DFO aimed to only correct FA (Group 1) or to additionally perform a varization (Group 2) in 14 cases each. In the remaining two cases, double-level osteotomies were performed to correct additional tibial deformities. In 25 cases (83.3%), concomitant procedures also addressing patellofemoral instability were performed. At follow-up (38.0 months [25–75% interquartile range 31.8–52.5 months]), a significant reduction in pain (VAS for pain: 2.0 [1.0–5.0] vs. 0 [0–1.0], p < 0.05), significant improvement in knee function (Kujala Score: 55.6 ± SD 13.6 vs. 80.3 ± 16.7, p < 0.05; Lysholm Score: 58.6 ± 17.4 vs. 79.5 ± 16.6, p < 0.05; IKDC: 54.6 ± 18.7 vs. 74.1 ± 15.0, p < 0.05), and an increase in sporting activity (TAS: 3.0 [3.0–4.0] vs. 4.0 [3.0–5.0], p = n.s.) were reported. Femoral antetorsion was significantly reduced (28.2 ± 6.4° vs. 13.6 ± 5.2°, p < 0.05). A significant varization was observed in Group 2 (2.4 ± 1.2° valgus vs. 0.3 ± 2.4° valgus; p < 0.05). In one case, patellar redislocation occurred 70 months postoperatively. Conclusion: In patients with PFI and an associated increased FA, D-DFO achieved a significant reduction in pain, an improvement of subjective knee function, as well as an adequate correction of torsional and coronal alignment.

Methods: The survey used the online questionnaire from AGA (Gesellschaft für Arthroskopie und Gelenkchirurgie; Society for Arthroscopy and Joint Surgery) to facilitate the comparison between different European countries. The questionnaire was distributed online to members of the HAOST (Hellenic Association of Orthopaedic Surgery and Trauma), the ΟΤΑΜΑΤ (Orthopaedic and Trauma Association of Macedonia and Thrace) and the CAOST (Cypriot Association of Orthopaedic Surgery and Trauma). The questionnaire consisted of 29 questions, which included demographic data, questions on the impact of the pandemic on the practice of orthopaedic surgery and questions on the impact on the personal and family life of orthopaedic surgeons. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 1350 orthopaedic surgeons in Greece and Cyprus, 303 of whom responded (response rate 22.44%). 11.2% of the participants reported cancellation of overall orthopaedic procedures. According to 35.6–49.8% of the participants, arthroscopic procedures were continued. As regards elective primary arthroplasties, 35.3% of the participants reported that these continued to be performed at their hospitals. Post-operative follow-ups as well as physiotherapy were affected by the pandemic, and changes were also observed in the habits of orthopaedic surgeons in their personal and family lives. Conclusion: The orthopaedic service in Greece and Cyprus decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Arthroscopic procedures and total joint replacements decreased significantly, but not to the same extent as in other countries. Health systems were not fully prepared for the first wave of the pandemic and the various countries took social measures at different times and to different extents. Thus, studying the impact of the pandemic on the practice of orthopaedic surgery in different countries can help health systems to better prepare for future pandemics; public health can then be shielded and hospitals can continue to provide high-quality orthopaedic care.

The type of anaesthesia has been suspected an influential factor in the post-operative recovery of muscle function. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, n = 442 consecutive patients undergoing primary isolated ACL reconstruction using a hamstring autograft were analysed by pre- and post-operative isokinetic tests in a single orthopaedic centre. These were subdivided into four cohorts: (1) general anaesthesia (n = 47), (2) general anaesthesia with prolonged (48 h) on-demand femoral nerve block (n = 37), (3) spinal anaesthesia (n = 169) and (4) spinal anaesthesia with prolonged (48 h) on-demand femoral nerve block (n = 185). Primary outcome was the change from pre- to post-operative isokinetic strength during knee extension and flexion. Results: Using one-way ANOVA, there was no significant influence of the type of anaesthesia. The main effect of anaesthesia on change in extension forces was not significant, and effect sizes were very small (n.s.). Similarly, the main effect of anaesthesia on change in flexion forces was statistically not significant (n.s.). Conclusions: The findings of this study support the interpretation that the type of anaesthesia has no significant effect on the ability to recover thigh muscle strength 6 months after isolated hamstring ACL reconstruction. With regard to the recovery of athletic performance and return-to-sports testing criteria, there is no reason to avoid regional anaesthesia.

Methods: In this prospective Cohort Study Level II multicentric trial, consecutive patients with a diagnosis of early/mild osteoarthritis and failure of previous conservative measures were enrolled to undergo diagnostic arthroscopy and a single MFAT injection. Patients were assessed with repeated scoring systems at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. The demographic features, the arthroscopic findings, the immunophenotype of injected tissue and the histologic examination of synovia of failed patients were analyzed. Results: Data from 91 patients showed a significant improvement in Lysholm, WOMAC scores at 1-year follow-up (p < 0.001). A significant decrease in VAS score was observed, while a significant improvement of measured flexion angle was registered at 1 year (p < 0.001). No major complications were reported. Age and synovitis were identified as significant factors influencing the clinical outcome (p < 0.05). Body mass index, previous or concomitant procedures, and specific cartilage defects had no influence. The mean number of injected adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells seem not to correlate with the clinical outcome. Conclusion: MFAT is effective in reducing pain when used with a single dose injection in early/mild OA of the knee, without major complications. Age over 60 and synovitis may be predictive for persistent pain at one year and should be considered before indications. © 2022, The Author(s).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85137872060,3113,0,,

Methods: A series of transtibial PCL reconstruction models were established with porcine tibias and bovine tendons. Specimens were randomly assigned to three groups according to the angles between the tibial tunnel and the perpendicular line of the tibial shaft: Group A (30°, n = 12), Group B (45°, n = 12), and Group C (60°, n = 12). The area of the tunnel entrance, the segmental bone mineral density (sBMD) of the graft fixation site of the tibia and the maximum insertion torque of the interference screw were measured. Finally, load to failure tests were carried out on the graft-screw-tibia constructs at the same rate. Results: Ultimate load to failure in Group C (335.2 ± 107.5 N) was significantly lower than that in Group A (584.1 ± 127.9 N, P < 0.01) and Group B (521.9 ± 95.9 N, P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between biomechanical properties of Groups A and B (n.s.). The posterior part fractures of the tibial tunnel exit occurred in eight specimens of Group C. In addition, the ultimate load was proven to be related to insertion torque (rho = 0.7, P < 0.01), sBMD (rho = 0.7, P < 0.01), and the area of the tunnel entrance (rho =− 0.4, P = 0.01). Conclusion: The ultimate load to failure was significantly lower in tibial PCL interference screw fixation for tunnels drilled at 60° compared to 30°/45°. In addition, the ultimate load was significantly correlated with insertion torque, sBMD and the area of the tunnel entrance. Given that the load to failure of distal fixation may not be sufficient for early postoperative rehabilitation, a 60° tunnel should not be recommended to drill in tibia during PCL reconstruction. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159451061,3145,0,,"G*Power, SPSS"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the number of arthroscopies previously performed and the arthroscopic skills acquired using a standardized simulator test. Methods: A total of 97 resident and early orthopaedic surgeons who participated in arthroscopic simulator training courses were divided into five groups based on their self-reported number of arthroscopic surgeries: (1) none, (2) < 10, (3) 10 to 19, (4) 20 to 39 and (5) 40 to 100. Arthroscopic manual skills were evaluated with a simulator by means of the diagnostic arthroscopy skill score (DASS) before and after training. Seventy-five points out of 100 must be achieved to pass the test. Results: In the pretest, only three trainees in group 5 passed the arthroscopic skill test, and all other participants failed. Group 5 (57 ± 17 points; n = 17) scored significantly higher than the other groups (group 1: 30 ± 14, n = 20; group 2: 35 ± 14, n = 24; group 3: 35 ± 18, n = 23; and group 4: 33 ± 17, n = 13). After a two-day simulator training, trainees showed a significant increase in performance. In group 5, participants scored 81 ± 17 points, which was significantly higher than the other groups (group 1: 75 ± 16; group 2: 75 ± 14; group 3: 69 ± 15; and group 4: 73 ± 13). While self-reported arthroscopic procedures were n.s. associated with higher log odds of passing the test (p = 0.423), the points scored in the pretest were found to be a good predictor of whether a trainee would pass the test (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between the points scored in the pretest and the posttest (p < 0.05, r = 0.59, r 2 = 0.34). Conclusions: The number of previously performed arthroscopies is not a reliable indicator of the skills level of orthopaedic residents. A reasonable alternative in the future would be to verify arthroscopic proficiency on the simulator by means of a score as a pass–fail examination.

Methods: Thirty consecutive patients (19 males, 11 females) aged between 40 and 75 years (mean age 56.4 ± 8.1 years) with unilateral symptomatic knee OA (Kellgren–Lawrence 2–3) were included in the study. Patients were treated with combined intra-articular and subchondral bone BMAC injections (total 9 ml) under fluoroscopic control. IKDC subjective score, VAS for pain, KOOS, and EQ-VAS were prospectively evaluated up to 24 months. Radiographs were performed at baseline and at 24 months after the procedure. MRI was evaluated with the WORMS score at baseline, 6–12 months, and 24 months of follow-up. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.19.0 and for all tests p < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: No major complications and a 13% failure rate were reported. The IKDC subjective score remained stable from 62.6 ± 19.4 at 12 months to 63.4 ± 17.1 at 24 months (both p < 0.0005 compared to baseline, 40.5 ± 12.5). Similar improvements were reported for all KOOS subscales, while EQ-VAS did not report any significant improvement. VAS pain worsened from 3.0 ± 1.9 at 12 months to 4.4 ± 1.8 at the final follow-up (p = 0.0001), although remaining lower compared to the baseline value of 6.3 ± 1.8 (p = 0.002). The radiographic evaluation did not reveal signs of improvement or deterioration of the OA grade. The MRI findings showed a worsening in marginal osteophytes and synovitis, but a significant reduction of bone marrow edema at 24 months (p < 0.0005). Conclusion: Combined intra-articular and subchondral BMAC injections provided clinical and imaging benefits up to 24 months for the treatment of symptomatic knee OA, with durable clinical results, a low failure rate, and a significant reduction of bone marrow edema. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, Arthroscopy (ESSKA).",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141435846,3334,0,,SPSS

The aim of this study was to determine whether the PCL–PCA is associated with chronicity of the ACL rupture, the meniscal status, preoperative knee laxity or imaging signs such as the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sign or the posterior tibial slope (PTS) in ACL-injured knees. Methods: Patients with a primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) after physeal closure were selected retrospectively from a hospital-based ACL registry from 2015 to 2021. Exclusion criteria were: previous ipsilateral/contralateral knee surgery, previous ipsilateral ACL or meniscal tear, ipsilateral PCL and/or collateral ligament injuries or tibial plateau fracture. The ACL deficiency was defined as chronic if time from injury to MRI was > 6 months. The meniscal status was assessed during ACLR, separately for the medial and lateral meniscus, and classified into no tear, minor or major unstable tear. The MRI analyses included the assessment of the PCL–PCA and the LCL sign. PTS was assessed from the lateral plain radiographs of the injured knee. The side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation (ATT) at 200N was obtained with the GNRB. Results: Eighty-two patients (forty-eight males/thirty-four females) were included in this study. The median PCL–PCA was 16.2° (Q1–Q3: 10.6–24.7) and differed between acute (18.4°) and chronic (10.7°) injuries (p < 0.01). The median PCL–PCA was significantly lower (− 4.6°) in patients with a positive LCL sign (p = 0.03) No significant association could be found between PCL–PCA and meniscal status, PTS or preoperative anterior knee laxity (Lachman, pivot shift and ATT in millimetres). Conclusion: The PCL–PCA was significantly lower in chronic ACL injuries and in patients with a positive LCL sign, indicating a higher buckling phenomenon of the PCL in these patients. These results support the fact that PCL–PCA and the LCL sign may be useful parameters to indicate the progression of knee decompensation over time after an ACL injury, and therefore may constitute a helpful tool to optimise treatment choice and timing of ACL reconstruction if necessary.

Our purpose was to determine the association between femoral articular cartilage T1ρ magnetic resonance imaging relaxation times and gait variability. Methods T1ρ magnetic resonance imaging and gait kinematics were collected in 22 ACLR participants (13 women; 21 ± 4 yr old; 7.52 ± 1.43 months post-ACLR). Femoral articular cartilage from the ACLR and uninjured limbs were segmented into anterior, central, and posterior regions from the weight-bearing portions of the medial and lateral condyles. Mean T1ρ relaxation times were extracted from each region and interlimb ratios (ILR) were calculated (i.e., ACLR/uninjured limb). Greater T1ρ ILR values were interpreted as less proteoglycan density (worse cartilage composition) in the injured limb compared with the uninjured limb. Knee kinematics were collected at a self-selected comfortable walking speed on a treadmill with an eight-camera three-dimensional motion capture system. Frontal and sagittal plane kinematics were extracted, and sample entropy was used to calculate kinematic variability structure (KVstructure). Pearson's product-moment correlations were conducted to determine the associations between T1ρ and KVstructure variables. Results Lesser frontal plane KVstructure was associated with greater mean T1ρ ILR in the anterior lateral (r =-0.44, P = 0.04) and anterior medial condyles (r =-0.47, P = 0.03). Lesser sagittal plane KVstructure was associated with greater mean T1ρ ILR in the anterior lateral condyle (r =-0.47, P = 0.03). Conclusions The association between less KVstructure and worse femoral articular cartilage proteoglycan density suggests a link between less variable knee kinematics and deleterious changes joint tissue changes. The findings suggest that less knee kinematic variability structure is a mechanism linking aberrant gait to early osteoarthritis development.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164845594,3531,1,"Stem and leaf plots to visually inspect outliers, data points greater than 2.5 SD identified as outliers, considered for removal, no outliers detected.",SPSS

Methods Using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, nine men (age, 28 ± 3 yr; weight, 75.4 ± 10.5 kg; height, 175 ± 7 cm; body fat, 12.9% ± 5%; VO2peak at 440 torr, 3.11 ± 0.65 L·min-1) completed a total of three visits including baseline testing and two experimental trials (placebo and ibuprofen) in a hypobaric chamber simulating an altitude of 4300 m. Preexercise and postexercise blood samples were assayed for intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), ileal bile acid binding protein, soluble cluster of differentiation 14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β, and interleukin-10.

Results Resting I-FABP (906 ± 395 vs 1168 ± 581 pg·mL-1; P = 0.008) and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (1512 ± 297 vs 1642 ± 313 ng·mL-1; P = 0.014) were elevated in the ibuprofen trial. Likewise, the urine lactulose-To-rhamnose ratio (0.217 vs 0.295; P = 0.047) and the preexercise to postexercise change in I-FABP (277 ± 308 vs 498 ± 479 pg·mL-1; P = 0.021) were greater in the ibuprofen trial. Participants also reported greater upper GI symptoms in the ibuprofen trial (P = 0.031). However, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (P = 0.007) and TNF-α (P = 0.047) were lower throughout the ibuprofen trial compared with placebo (main effect of condition). Conclusions These data demonstrate that acute ibuprofen ingestion aggravates markers of enterocyte injury and intestinal barrier dysfunction at rest and after exercise in hypoxia. However, ibuprofen seems to suppress circulating markers of inflammation.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85144141408,3741,0,,GraphPad Prism

Methods Eighteen participants (56 ± 9 yr) with stable angina performed four treadmill stress tests in a randomized crossover design at +20°C and -8°C, with and without a 24-km·h-1 headwind. Time to ischemia (≥1-mm ST-segment depression) and angina, rate pressure product, and total exercise duration were determined. Results At -8°C, time to ischemia was reduced by 22% (-58 s (-85 to -31 s), P < 0.01) compared with +20°C. The addition of wind at -8°C reduced time to ischemia by a further 15% (-31 s (-58 to -4 s) vs -8°C without wind, P = 0.02). The addition of wind did not affect time to ischemia at +20°C (P = 0.38). Cold temperature and wind did not affect time to angina (P = 0.46 and P = 0.61) or rate pressure product (P = 0.46 and P = 0.09). Total exercise time was reduced in the presence of wind at -8°C (-29 s (-51 to -7 s), P = 0.01), but not at +20°C (P = 0.09). Conclusions The presence of wind reduces time to ischemia when exercise stress testing is performed in a cold environment. These results suggest that wind should be considered when evaluating the risks posed by cold weather in patients with coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ischemia.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159732606,3644,0,,GraphPad Prism

We previously found that acute ingestion of 0.6 g·kg-1 body mass KE increased exercise heart rate (HR) compared with placebo. Purpose This study aimed to examine the effect of KE ingestion on exercise cardiac output (Q˙) and the influence of blood acidosis. We hypothesized that KE versus placebo ingestion would increase Q˙, and coingestion of the pH buffer bicarbonate would mitigate this effect. Methods In a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner, 15 endurance-trained adults (peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), 60 ± 9 mL·kg-1·min-1) ingested either 0.2 g·kg-1 sodium bicarbonate or a salt placebo 60 min before exercise, and 0.6 g·kg-1 KE or a ketone-free placebo 30 min before exercise. Supplementation yielded three experimental conditions: basal ketone bodies and neutral pH (CON), hyperketonemia and blood acidosis (KE), and hyperketonemia and neutral pH (KE + BIC). Exercise involved 30 min of cycling at ventilatory threshold intensity, followed by determinations of VO2peak and peak Q˙. Results Blood [β-hydroxybutyrate], a ketone body, was higher in KE (3.5 ± 0.1 mM) and KE + BIC (4.4 ± 0.2) versus CON (0.1 ± 0.0, P < 0.0001). Blood pH was lower in KE versus CON (7.30 ± 0.01 vs 7.34 ± 0.01, P < 0.001) and KE + BIC (7.35 ± 0.01, P < 0.001). Q˙ during submaximal exercise was not different between conditions (CON: 18.2 ± 3.6, KE: 17.7 ± 3.7, KE + BIC: 18.1 ± 3.5 L·min-1; P = 0.4). HR was higher in KE (153 ± 9 bpm) and KE + BIC (154 ± 9) versus CON (150 ± 9, P < 0.02). VO2peak (P = 0.2) and peak Q˙ (P = 0.3) were not different between conditions, but peak workload was lower in KE (359 ± 61 W) and KE + BIC (363 ± 63) versus CON (375 ± 64, P < 0.02). Conclusions KE ingestion did not increase Q˙ during submaximal exercise despite a modest elevation of HR. This response occurred independent of blood acidosis and was associated with a lower workload at VO2peak. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163286096,3642,0,,GraphPad Prism

Therefore, the purpose was to quantify patellofemoral force and stress between two bodyweight squat variations (ball squat vs wall squat) and between two heel-to-wall-distance (HTWD) variations (long HTWD vs short HTWD). Methods Sixteen participants performed a dynamic ball squat and wall squat with long HTWD and short HTWD. Ground reaction force and kinematic data were used to measure resultant knee force and torque from inverse dynamics, whereas electromyographic data were used in a knee muscle model to predict resultant knee force and torque, and subsequently, all these data were inputted into a biomechanical computer optimization model to output patellofemoral joint force and stress at select knee angles. A repeated-measures two- and three-way ANOVA (P < 0.01) was used for statistical analyses. Results Collapsed across long HTWD and short HTWD, patellofemoral joint force and stress were greater in ball squat than wall squat at 30° (P = 0.009), 40° (P = 0.008), 90° (P = 0.003), and 100° (P = 0.005) knee angles during the squat descent, and greater in wall squat than ball squat at 100° (P < 0.001), 90° (P < 0.001), 80° (P = 0.004), and 70° (P = 0.009) knee angles during squat ascent. Collapsed across ball and wall squats, patellofemoral joint force and stress were greater with a short HTWD than a long HTWD at 100° (P = 0.007) and 90° (P = 0.008) knee angles during squat ascent. Conclusions Patellofemoral joint loading changed according to both squat type and HTWD variations. These differences occurred in part due to differences in forces the wall or ball exerted on the trunk, including friction forces. Overall, patellofemoral force and stress were greater performing the bodyweight wall squat compared with the bodyweight ball squat. Moreover, squatting with short HTWD produced anterior knee displacement beyond the toes at higher knee angles, resulting in greater patellofemoral force and stress compared with squatting with long HTWD. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85168221584,3581,0,,

Methods This cross-sectional study included 88 medical-naive children with ADHD age 6-12 yr (mean (SD) age, 8.43 (1.38) yr; 81.8% boys) and 40 age-matched children with TD (mean (SD) age, 8.46 (1.44) yr; 60% boys). MVPA was recorded by a wGT3X-BT accelerometer for 7 consecutive days. Motor proficiency was assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development-Third Edition. Sleep quality was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Results Children with ADHD spent significantly less time in MVPA daily, displayed less proficiency in locomotor and ball skills, and reported poorer sleep quality (e.g., longer sleep latency, less sleep duration, and lower sleep efficiency) than children with TD. MVPA guideline attainment and sleep duration significantly predicted locomotor skills development; in turn, locomotor skills predicted MVPA guideline attainment. MVPA and ball skills increased by age in children with ADHD. Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of promoting MVPA, motor proficiency, and sleep duration in children with ADHD and TD since childhood.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171394026,3567,0,,SPSS

However, its efficacy on several aspects of health is largely unknown. Purpose This study aimed to determine the effects of regular ANW on glycemic control and vascular function in older adults with type 2 diabetes and mild cognitive impairment. Methods Thirty-three older adults with type 2 diabetes age 60-75 yr were randomly allocated to nonexercising control (n = 17) or ANW (n = 17) groups. Nordic walking was performed in a pool at water temperature of 34°C-36°C, three times per week for 12 wk. Results Measures of functional physical fitness including chair stand, timed up and go, chair sit and reach, reach and back scratch, and 6-min walk test scores were all improved after ANW (all P < 0.05). Plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance decreased (all P < 0.05) in ANW. Vascular reactivity as assessed by brachial flow-mediated dilation increased, and arterial stiffness as assessed by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity decreased in ANW (all P < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in the control group. Middle cerebral artery pulsatility index decreased with ANW under normocapnia condition (P < 0.05). Cerebrovascular conductance increased with ANW under hypercapnia condition. Montreal Cognitive Assessment score increased in the ANW group (P < 0.001). Changes in Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores were positively associated with corresponding changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (r = 0.540, P = 0.031). Conclusions Nordic walking in water was a safe and effective innovative exercise modality to improve glycemic control, vascular function, physical fitness, cerebrovascular reactivity, and cognitive function in older adults with type 2 diabetes.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171394021,3579,1,"Grubb's outlier test, 1-3 outliers identified and removed.","G*Power, SPSS, GraphPad Prism"

However, differences in coordination demands and limb involvement between exercise modes may also affect the communication and organization of brain networks after exercise and should be considered additionally. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mode on exercise-induced changes in electroencephalogaphy (EEG) resting-state networks comparing running (RUN) and cross-country skating (XC). Methods Fifteen male, highly trained participants were tested for peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) during RUN (65.3 mL·min-1·kg-1) and XC (63.5 mL·min-1·kg-1) followed by incremental protocols at 50%, 70%, and 90% of speed at VO2peak in both modes on the treadmill. After each exercise bout, 5-min resting-state EEG assessments using 64 channels were performed. Upon graph theory, small world index (SWI), clustering coefficient (CC), and path length (PL) were assessed in theta, alpha-1 and alpha-2 frequency bands. Repeated-measures ANOVA was applied to analyze the influence of exercise intensity and mode on modulations in brain network efficiency. Results Main effects of mode on SWI (P = 0.047), CC (P < 0.001), and PL (P = 0.031) in the alpha-2 network indicated stronger modulations in network efficiency after XC. Main effects of exercise intensity in the theta network indicated modulated SWI (P < 0.001), CC (P < 0.001), and PL (P = 0.003) after exercise at 90% of VO2peak speed. Physiological outcomes (heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and rating of perceived exertion) were influenced by intensity solely. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that an acute bout of coordinatively challenging endurance exercise may affect brain networks differently compared with running. Future studies may consider exercise mode as a potential moderator in the acute interaction between exercise and the brain.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159736597,3634,0,,SPSS

We set out to investigate the effects of exercise training and supplemental oxygen on functional and structural peripheral muscle adaptation. Methods In this prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study, 28 patients with nonhypoxemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, 45.92% ± 9.06%) performed 6 wk of combined endurance and strength training, three times a week while breathing either supplemental oxygen or medical air. The impact on exercise capacity, muscle strength, and quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was assessed by maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 10-repetition maximum strength test of knee extension, and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Results After exercise training, patients demonstrated a significant increase in functional capacity, aerobic capacity, exercise tolerance, quadriceps muscle strength, and bilateral CSA. Supplemental oxygen affected significantly the training impact on peak work rate when compared with medical air (+0.20 ± 0.03 vs +0.12 ± 0.03 W·kg-1, P = 0.047); a significant increase in CSA (+3.9 ± 1.3 cm2, P = 0.013) was only observed in the training group using oxygen. Supplemental oxygen and exercise-induced peripheral desaturation were identified as significant opposing determinants of muscle gain during this exercise training intervention, which led to different adaptations of CSA between the respective subgroups. Conclusions The heterogenous functional and structural muscle adaptations seem determined by supplemental oxygen and exercise-induced hypoxia. Indeed, supplemental oxygen may facilitate muscular training adaptations, particularly in limb muscle dysfunction, thereby contributing to the enhanced training responses on maximal aerobic and functional capacity.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85177103753,3519,0,,

Postprandial endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation (FMD%)) in SA women and SA men with central obesity has not been investigated. Research in other populations has highlighted that a 1% higher FMD% is associated with a 13% lower risk of future CVD events. We investigated whether FMD% and lipemia, two markers for CVD risk, were higher in SAs versus WEs, whether walking improved FMD% and lipemia, and if there were ethnic differences in the response. Methods Lean premenopausal women (study 1; 12 SA, 12 WE) and men with central obesity (study 2; 15 SA, 15 WE) completed two 2-d trials. On day 1, participants walked for 60 min at 60% of their peak oxygen uptake or rested. On day 2, participants rested and consumed two high-fat meals over 8 h. Repeated ultrasound assessments of endothelial function and venous blood samples for CVD risk markers were taken. Results Compared with WEs, SAs had lower postprandial FMD% (study 1, -1.32%; study 2, -0.54%) and higher postprandial triacylglycerol concentrations (study 1, 0.31 mmol·L-1·h-1; study 2, 0.55 mmol·L-1·h-1). Walking improved postprandial FMD% (study 1, 1.12%; study 2, 0.94%) and resulted in no significant change or small reductions in postprandial triacylglycerol concentrations (study 1, -0.01 mmol·L-1·h-1; study 2, -0.25 mmol·L-1·h-1). Exercise-induced changes in FMD% and triacylglycerol were consistent between ethnic groups. Conclusions Walking mitigated the adverse postprandial effect of a high-fat diet on FMD% to a similar extent in SA and WE women and men, even with no/small improvements in triacylglycerol. This study highlights the importance of exercise to clinically improve FMD% in SAs and WEs.

However, it is not known if benefits exist for postprandial glucose, insulin and triglyceride responses in the evening, and if these benefits differ by body mass index (BMI) category. Methods In a randomized crossover study, 30 participants (25.4 ± 5.4 yr old; BMI 18.5-24.9: n = 10, BMI 25-29.9: n = 10, BMI ≥30: n = 10) completed two intervention arms, beginning at ∼1700 h: prolonged sitting for 4 h, and sitting with regular activity breaks of 3 min of resistance exercises every 30 min. Plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured in response to two meals fed at baseline and 120 min. Four-hour incremental area under the curve was compared between interventions. Moderation by BMI status was explored. Results Overall, when compared with prolonged sitting, regular activity breaks lowered plasma glucose and insulin incremental area under the curve by 31.5% (95% confidence interval =-49.3% to-13.8%) and 26.6% (-39.6% to-9.9%), respectively. No significant differences were found for plasma triglyceride area under the curve. Interactions between BMI status and intervention was not statistically significant. Conclusions Interventions that interrupt sedentary time in the evening may improve cardiometabolic health by some magnitude in all participants regardless of bodyweight.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164843089,3679,0,,STATA

Reciprocal peer learning is a teaching strategy where students work in pairs as tutor and tutee. Effective peer tutoring requires knowledge about the critical elements for correct performance (i.e. common content knowledge, CCK) and knowing how to detect and address common errors (i.e. specialized content knowledge, SCK). Research on training students for their task as tutor to increase peer learning effectiveness is limited. Purpose and research question: This study documents an online approach to prepare students for their role as tutor during reciprocal peer learning. Also, it investigates the effect of online CCK + SCK-training versus online CCK-only training on (a) skill performance by tutees and error detection by tutors during peer learning; and (b) individual skill performance at a 1-week retention test. Methods: Seventy-seven undergraduate students (25 female, 52 male) were randomly assigned to an online CCK + SCK (n = 37) or CCK-only (n = 40) training for learning Basic Life Support (BLS) as part of their curriculum. All participants learned online the correct procedure for BLS according to international guidelines (i.e. CCK). In the CCK + SCK condition, students additionally learned online to detect and correct four common errors related to chest compression. Following the online training all students learned BLS using reciprocal peer learning with manikins. For each student pair skill performance during practice by tutees was reported using digital manikins and error detection by tutors was collected using systematic observation of video recordings. One week following practice (i.e. retention), BLS-performance was assessed individually using a validated protocol. Findings: During peer learning, SCK-trained tutees performed less unique errors (Mdn = 2 vs. 1, p <.05) and SCK-trained tutors detected a higher proportion of unique errors (Mdn 100% vs. 0%, p <.05) compared to CCK-only trained students. At retention, SCK-trained students outperformed the CCK-group for chest compressions with adequate rate (Mdn 91% vs. 69% p <.05) and complete release (Mdn 81% vs. 35% p <.05). Conclusions: Teaching undergraduate students online to detect and correct errors positively impacted the quality of practice during peer learning and the performance at retention. © 2023 Association for Physical Education.",Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171287422,3773,0,,SPSS

Comparing two modes of implementation of a physical education-based intervention to improve motor competence among Irish adolescents,2023,Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,10.1080/17408989.2023.2284928,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177564413&doi=10.1080%2f17408989.2023.2284928&partnerID=40&md5=c9d88bf78779d260c759a61643431a40,"Background: Adequate levels of motor competence (MC) have been associated with multiple health outcomes. Despite the preponderance of effective MC interventions, globally, levels of MC in children and adolescents are low. There is a gap in understanding what leads to effective implementation of MC interventions into routine practice, to benefit the wider population. Purpose: This study aims to compare implementation outcomes of two versions of Project FLAME: one group of teachers implementing Project FLAME as per the original efficacy trial (‘Original FLAME’), a second group of teachers implementing Project FLAME incorporating three additional implementation strategies (‘Modified FLAME’). Methods: A mixed method, two-group pre-and-post design, lasting six weeks during the period of September to November 2021. Three implementation evaluation outcomes were assessed: (i) PE teacher’s self-efficacy in delivering Project FLAME; (ii) Fidelity and adaptation to the project protocol; and (iii) Teachers’ and students’ responsiveness to the project. Data were collected at student and teacher levels using online survey and interviews. Nine PE teachers and their classes from eight schools consented to participate. Descriptives were reported for quantitative online survey data, and qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results: The final analytical sample included data from 9 teachers and 127 students pre- and post-study. Irrespective of implementation group, teachers with low levels of self-efficacy at the baseline improved after the six-week intervention. Teachers’ fidelity to the use of pedagogical external cues and error identification were high in both groups, with more adaptations made in the Modified FLAME group. Students’ satisfaction towards the intervention was high in both groups, with the use of pedagogical external cues reported as highly preferable. Conclusion: Findings provide evidence on the ‘non-negotiable’ features of Project FLAME that have the potential to be implemented for a longer-term in Physical Education settings (e.g. external teaching cues). The documented implementation of Project FLAME provide knowledge on what adaptations may be needed to translate an effective MC intervention into real-world practice. The study reaffirms that documenting the implementation (especially fidelity and adaptation) of MC interventions is beneficial. © 2023 The Author(s).

PE is influenced by children’s everyday lives and by changes in society, including the powerful presence of digital technology. However, there is little research on using digital technology in the context of invasion games in primary school PE. The possibility of combining video tagging and the didactic-methodical staging of PE to cover the content of football is investigated in the present study. Purpose: The study aims to (1) investigate student’s perspectives of the emerging role of a camera child (video tagger), and (2) assess how students interact with video products created in a game-based football approach in primary school PE. The focus is on the communication and interaction processes among students. Processes of movement education, general education and media education are all of interest. Method: In six Grade 4 classes in Germany, a football unit was taught over three lessons of 90 min each using the Teaching Games for Understanding method, preceded by one 90-minute media education lesson on various media pedagogical topics. In the lessons, the students were divided into teams of four and presented with football in the context of three-versus-three games. The fourth child on each team took on the camera-child role and tagged important game situations with an app on a tablet. The lessons were then evaluated based on the research approach of focusing on the students’ perspectives. For this purpose, 104 guided interviews with students were conducted and analysed using grounded theory. Findings: Based on the interview analysis, the phenomena that students experienced when using tablets were classified as: (1) ambivalent position of the camera child (with the subcategories of the camera child’s limited influence on the game and limiting and facilitating phenomena for the camera-child role), and (2) conserved and stored movements (with the subcategories of media-supported conflict management and slow-motion distorting reality). The results showed that physical activity was more important to students than using tablets. Conclusion: The use of digital media offers a greater variety of methods and allows children new and expanded access to invasion games like football. In the process, (sports) pedagogical and didactic goals also change and are expanded to include media pedagogical aims. Social learning is also important in this context. In orchestrating digitally enhanced instruction, new opportunities open up in terms of learning and experiencing movement and learning about media and the media products created. © 2023 The Author(s).

The facilitator plays a key role in ensuring these effective measures are fostered. However, literature specific to facilitators’ (e.g. teachers, professional development (PD) providers) roles and responsibilities with loose parts play is limited. It is the intention of this research to expand beyond what loose parts play is and its benefits, and include how it can be implemented in a safe and meaningful way from the perspective of the facilitator. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to explore Adrian’s roles and responsibilities as a facilitator of PD about loose parts play. Investigating and critiquing the roles and responsibilities of Adrian, has the potential to offer evidence and insight to individuals and school communities considering their own loose parts play implementation. Method: This research used a self-study methodology. A self-study allowed Adrian to focus on learning from and through their experience as a facilitator to ultimately challenge and/or reinforce their pedagogical approaches for providing PD on loose parts play implementation. Self-study methodology allowed for in-depth explanations of Adrian’s roles and responsibilities and while interrogating their new learning to share insights to improve facilitation practices. Data from facilitation sessions and guided journal reflections were collected and analysed using Braun and Clarke’s (2012) thematic analysis framework. Findings: Five themes describe the roles and responsibilities of a loose parts play facilitator: (a) experiential learning; (b) explicit communication; (c) contextual considerations; (d) relationships and (e) reflective practice. The themes generated reinforce existing findings in the literature on facilitation and PD such as offering experiences that are ‘hands-on’ and practically involving the audience; ensuring clearly communicated goals are part of the instruction process; deepening relationships by engaging dialogue between school communities; knowing your audience and adapting to their needs and readiness; and encouraging participants to be reflective. This research contributes to the literature, validating the roles and responsibilities of the facilitator, by demonstrating continuity between the five themes and the components of Comprehensive School Health (healthy school policy; social and physical environment; teaching and learning; partnerships and services) a framework used to build healthy school communities. For example, school policy can be unique to its context and needs to be explicitly communicated with all involved partners to ensure the expectations of implementation are commonly understood. Additionally, teaching and learning includes drawing upon and acknowledging a participant’s lived experience with play through experiential play opportunities. Furthermore, one way to attend to the social environment is to foster relationships with students by guiding their involvement throughout implementation. Whereas the quality and availability of the physical environment, specific to each context, will impact where, when and how play can be facilitated. Conclusion: In committing to these roles and responsibilities the facilitator is dedicated to facilitating PD about, and implementing loose parts play using a comprehensive approach that supports the achievement of academic and health outcomes in students. © 2023 Association for Physical Education.",Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159911768,3753,0,,

Given that most studies have focused on explicit stereotype induction among adults, the main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of explicit and implicit gender stereotypes on standing long jump performance in children. The second aim was to investigate the effects of these same manipulations on children's state anxiety. Design: A mixed model design with within-between-subject was used with standing long jump performance and state anxiety as dependent variables. Method: Two hundred and four children (Mage = 10.95 years, SDage = 0.85) participated in this study and were randomly assigned, after baseline measurement, into four different groups (i.e., explicit/implicit vs. explicit vs. implicit vs. control). Specifically, participants performed 8 trials of standing long jump (4 trials during the baseline phase and 4 trials during the experimental phase). Children also completed the competitive state Anxiety Inventory at baseline as well as immediately after the trials. Results: For motor performance, children in the explicit/implicit group and in the implicit group were negatively affected by the stereotype manipulation during all trials whereas participants in the explicit group were only negatively impacted during the last two trials. However, regarding state anxiety, children were negatively affected after both explicit only and implicit only manipulations and more significantly after explicit/implicit manipulation. Conclusions: The present research showed that the explicit and implicit manipulations influenced motor performance differently, but that these two manipulations increased state anxiety in the same way. Moreover, the combination of the explicit and implicit inductions leads to a greater significant negative influence on state anxiety but not motor performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141752123,3962,0,,

Yet, the role of coach and teammates in nurturing self-compassion (SC), reducing self-pity (SP), and helping to regulate emotions (RESE) has not been fully investigated. Therefore, this study explored the interrelationships between perceptions of the caring climate (CC), SC, SP, RESE, and reactions to an emotionally difficult sport scenario (REs) and specific ways coaches and teammates helped or hindered SC. 224 predominately White (79%), female (69%), male (30%), and non-binary (1%) undergraduate students (Mage = 18.44, SD = 0.66) involved in a high school sport the previous year, participated in an online survey. The survey included measures of CC, SC, SP, RESE, and REs along with four open-ended questions asking participants to reflect on how coaches and teammates helped or hindered development of SC. Correlations revealed CC was positively related to RESE and SC and negatively related to SP. Further, CC was positively associated with constructive REs and negatively associated with deconstructive REs. To test whether RESE, SC, and SP mediated the relationship between the CC and REs, a path analysis was conducted.

Additionally, SC, SP, and RESE differentially predicted REs. Thematic analysis of the open-ended questions revealed higher order themes of emotional, esteem, informational, and conditional support with a variety of supports being used by coaches and teammates. These findings provide insight into how coaches may be able to support athletes’ SC and RESE to navigate challenges within sport. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151536474,3838,1,identified but kept as did not alter the findings.,SPSS

We examined the effects of an online physical literacy professional development program—relative to continuing with ‘standard’ practice—on early childhood educators’ physical literacy knowledge and application. Methods: We conducted a parallel two-arm randomised controlled trial, in which 88 early childhood educators were randomly assigned to an online professional development program designed to support educators’ physical literacy instructional skills (intervention arm; n = 37), or a ‘standard practice’ control condition (n = 51). Data were collected prior to and after the four-week intervention period. We measured educators’ physical literacy knowledge and application (our primary outcome) through independent coding of open-ended survey responses, and educators’ self-reported perceptions of values, confidence, behaviours, and barriers (secondary outcomes). Between-group differences were assessed through analysis of covariance. Results: One intervention arm participant withdrew from the study, resulting in 87 participants included in analysis. Educators in the intervention arm scored significantly higher on post-intervention physical literacy knowledge (d = 0.62) and application (d = 0.33) than those in the control arm. Educators in the intervention arm also scored significantly higher than controls on confidence in teaching physical activity (d = 0.42) and significantly lower than controls on perceived personal barriers to physical activity (d = 0.53). Thirteen participants in the intervention arm (36%) did not begin the online professional development program. Conclusion: Improvements in physical literacy instructional outcomes indicate the potential for further investigation into broader implementation of online professional development programs of this nature in the future. © 2023 The Authors",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159058651,3848,0,,SPSS

According to the model, ego depleting tasks requiring self-control resources impair performance on subsequent tasks that also require self-control resources. However, several lines of evidence challenge this model, including evidence of improved exercise performance following longer cognitive tasks. Our study investigated the effects of cognitive task duration on (1) subsequent physical endurance performance, (2) concurrent cognitive task performance, and (3) subsequent novel cognitive task performance. Adopting an experimental design, with Stroop task type (incongruent, congruent) and duration (5, 10, 20 min) as between-participant factors, participants (N = 180) completed a color word Stroop task, an isometric handgrip to exhaustion task, and a novel 5-min incongruent number word Stroop task. In the handgrip task, endurance performance was worse following incongruent word Stroop than congruent word Stroop for 10-min tasks but not 5-min and 20-min tasks. In the word Stroop task, accuracy was lower and speed was slower following incongruent word Stroop than congruent word Stroop. Importantly, reaction times improved with longer task durations. In the novel number Stroop task, accuracy was higher following incongruent word Stroop than congruent word Stroop. In conclusion, the finding that the ego depletion effect was moderated by cognitive task duration is better explained by the expected value of control model than the strength model. © 2023 The Authors",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161318004,3847,0,,SPSS

However, research has been mostly limited to aerobic and resistance exercise. Considering that stretching activities are also an important component of physical fitness, this quasi-experimental study was designed to: 1) compare affective responses during and immediately after stretching exercises in apparently healthy adults, and 2) assess the consistency and repeatability of affect ratings obtained one week apart. For this purpose, we analyzed the Feeling Scale (FS) and Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) ratings using Time (during and after stretching) x Intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) x Stretched Muscle Group (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, latissimus dorsi, triceps) with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANCOVA) in 34 participants (21 males; aged 32.8 ± 8.6 years). The repeatability of FS and FAS ratings was assessed using two-way random-effects models, Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. FS scores were higher following the stretching exercises, whereas FAS scores were lower, particularly in the vigorous intensity. In general, the inter-day repeatability for FS and FAS measurements was good across muscle groups. ICC tended to be higher at vigorous intensities. Ratings of core affect can be collected during static passive stretches using the FAS and FAS in ecologically valid settings. These results suggest that an adequate assessment of core affective responses to stretching activities should be performed during the exercises. © 2023 The Authors",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171632920,3886,1,Manual screening,"SPSS, R"

Unfortunately, there is still a dearth of knowledge on how both these cognitive (i.e., executive functions; EF) and psycho-behavioural (i.e., psychological characteristics of developing excellence; PCDE) skills develop in youth athletes. Especially for athletes in early specialisation sports such as artistic gymnastics, the early EF and PCDE development might be important to be able to cope with the pressure and challenges that comes with a transition to the next stage. In the current study, artistic gymnasts between 9 and 22 years old were tested twice with a 12-month interval to investigate the changes in EF and PCDE. Results showed that EF developed within the youngest stage, but plateaued at the later stages. Most PCDE did not seem to change over time within each stage. Furthermore, the transition to a new stage does not seem to coincide with an increased improvement of PCDE. However, with a case study approach in the oldest stages, still inter-individual differences in EF and PCDE scores over time were observed. This study shows that EF and PCDE develop over time, albeit in a non-linear way, and along a variety of developmental trajectories. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148354357,3882,1,No details provided.,JASP

The Liverpool Co-PARS project was a four-year iterative process in which a physical activity referral scheme for inactive patients with health conditions was developed, refined, and evaluated. The aim of the present study was to explore multidisciplinary stakeholder perspectives of those involved in the co-production of Co-PARS and inform recommendations for future co-production research. We invited 5 stakeholders (service user, exercise referral practitioner, fitness centre manager, general practitioner/public health commissioner, and an academic) to co-author the present paper and provide their reflections of co-production. Four non-academic stakeholders completed a ~ 30-minute phone discussion of their personal reflections of the co-production process, transcribed in real-time by the first author and edited and checked for accuracy by the stakeholder. The fifth, academic author completed their reflections in writing. The multi-stakeholder reflections presented in this paper highlight identified strengths (multidisciplinary perspectives that were listened to and acted upon, co-production that permeated throughout the research project, real-time intervention adaptation) and challenges (homogeneous sample of service users, power imbalances, and a modestly adapted intervention) of co-production. We propose that co-production could be seen as a pro-active tool for the development of health service interventions, by mitigating potential issues encountered during latter implementation phases. We conclude with five key recommendations to facilitate future co-production research. © 2022 The Author(s).

Extending a previous study that identified the narrative typologies that scaffold elite athletes’ stories of sports injury experiences, the aim of this study was to critically reflect (i.e. introspective, intersubjective), on member reflections with participants to understand how these storylines were received and interpreted. Data was analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Using narrative theory as a theoretical lens, five reflexive themes were identified: (a) confronting the dominant narrative, (b) embracing new materialism, (c) extending boundaries of tellability, (d) linear and polyphonic narratives, and (e) symbolic violence. This study provides evidence of how the process of member reflections can enrich and extend our theoretical understandings and offers considerations about how to shift our social and cultural worlds to become more inclusive and diverse. © 2022 The Author(s).

Our study included 452 older adults who took part in our survey in both 2012/2013 and 2017/2018. The seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured both at baseline and at the 5 years follow-up. The frequencies of the different physical activities at baseline were assessed using a questionnaire. A generalized linear mixed model was used to estimate the non-standardized coefficient (B) of BP change associated with flexibility activity, after adjustments for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, antihypertensive medication use, history of heart disease, walking time, and muscle-strengthening activity as a fixed-effect, and area of residence as a random-effect. Higher flexibility-activity frequency was significantly associated with reduced SBP (B = -0.77 [95% confidence intervals = −1.36, −0.18], p for linear trend = 0.01, p for quadratic trend = 0.85) and DBP (−0.33 [−0.71, 0.05], p for linear trend = 0.09, p for quadratic trend = 0.04). Engaging in flexibility activity for 3 days per week was significantly associated with a reduction in DBP (B = −4.16, 95% CI [−7.53, −0.79], p = 0.02) compared with that in the reference group (0 days per week). Interaction tests were not significant between basic variables (sex, age, BMI, and antihypertensive medication) and flexibility. In conclusion, higher flexibility activity frequency was associated with a reduction in BP in older adults. Future longitudinal and interventional studies should examine the effects of flexibility activity on cardiovascular disease prevention. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Although recent research suggests that stroboscopic vision puts a training stimulus to the central nervous system, the underlying mechanism how it affects motion perception and processing in the brain is still unknown. Twenty-six participants performed a computer-based simple reaction test in response to a visual motion stimulus under normal (baseline) and stroboscopic conditions (5 Hz frequency, 40% duty cycle) (stroboscopic). A third condition under normal vision intermittently stopped the motion stimulus at the same frequency and duty cycle as in the stroboscopic condition. This condition controlled for the amount of visual motion information independent of the shutter glasses (screen shutter) and provided information about the effect of luminance changes induced by the stroboscopic eyewear. A 64-channel EEG was recorded to determine the amplitude and latency of the N2 component as a correlate of visual motion perception in the motion-sensitive visual area MT. Reaction time under stroboscopic conditions was significantly delayed when compared to both the baseline (p < 0.001) and screen shutter (p < 0.001) conditions. This was accompanied by a significantly prolonged N2 latency (p < 0.001) and lower N2 amplitude (p < 0.001) with the shutter glasses. There was no difference in reaction time or N2 amplitude/latency between the baseline and screen shutter condition (p ≥ 0.176). Stroboscopic eyewear delays the speed of visual motion perception and processing in the central nervous system and reduces the visuomotor reaction speed. This may form the neurophysiological basis for performance gains following stroboscopic training. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Studies of interlimb asymmetry in the lower limbs have shown high between-subject variability that does not depend on the side of dominance and that does not change with fatigue. Upper limb asymmetry is particularly large in manual wheelchair athletes with a lower degree of impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate interlimb asymmetry of forces developed during an upper limb Wingate anaerobic test, the effects of fatigue on force, and differences between high- and low-point players. Method: Twenty-five wheelchair basketball players (13 females and 12 males) of male and female national French teams performed a 30s anaerobic Wingate test on an arm ergometer. Participants were classified into two functional categories, high-point (classed from 3 to 4.5) and low-point (classed from 1 to 2.5), according to the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation classification. Left and right arm forces were measured during the pushing and pulling phases at peak power, 10s, and the end of the 30s test. Results: Upper limb asymmetry changed with fatigue during each phase. Force asymmetry differed between peak power, 10s and 30s, with no consistent increase or decrease. Asymmetry did not differ significantly between low- and high-point players but tended to be greater in high-point players. Asymmetry tended to be greater in the females, with significant differences between the males and females in the push phase. Conclusion: Inter-subject variability was high, but forces were asymmetric for most participants, especially females. The Wingate anaerobic test could highlight problematic asymmetries that might impact daily life or sports performance. © 2023 The Authors.

We tested if men and women are equally interested and willing to undergo exercise research procedures and if they consider different factors when deciding to participate. Two samples completed an online survey. Sample 1 (129 men, 227 women) responded to advertisements on social media and survey-sharing websites. Sample 2 (155 men, 504 women) was comprised of undergraduate psychology students. In both samples, men were significantly more interested to learn their muscle mass amount, running speed, jump height, and ball throwing ability, and more willing to receive electrical shocks, cycle or run until exhaustion, complete strength training that causes muscle soreness, and take muscle-building supplements (all p ≤ 0.013, d = 0.23–0.48). Women were significantly more interested to learn their flexibility, and more willing to complete surveys, participate in stretching and group aerobics interventions, and participate in home exercise with online instruction (all p ≤ 0.021, d = 0.12–0.71). Women rated the following significantly more important when deciding to participate: study's implications for society; personal health status; confidence in own abilities; potential anxiety during testing; type of research facility; time to complete study; and invasiveness, pain/discomfort, and possible side effects of procedures (all p < 0.05, d = 0.26–0.81). Differences in interest and willingness to participate in research probably contribute to different proportions of men and women as participants in exercise research. Knowledge of these differences might help researchers develop recruitment strategies aimed at encouraging both men and women to participate in exercise studies. © 2023 The Authors.

Fifty-two healthy sedentary young (20–28 years) men were randomly assigned to the IL-EF, IL-KF, CL-EF, and CL-KF groups (n = 13/group). Thirty maximal eccentric contractions of the EF were performed in IL-EF and CL-EF, and 60 maximal eccentric contractions of the KF were performed in IL-KF and CL-KF, with a 2-week interval between bouts. Changes in muscle damage markers such as maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque, muscle soreness, and plasma creatine kinase activity, and proprioception measures before to 5 days post-exercise were compared between groups. Changes in all variables were greater (p < 0.05) after the first than second bout for all groups, and the changes were greater (p < 0.05) for the EF than KF. The changes in all variables after the second bout were greater (p < 0.05) for the CL than IL condition for both EF and KF. The magnitude of the average protective effect was similar between CL-EF (33%) and CL-KF (32%), but slightly greater (p < 0.05) for IL-EF (67%) than IL-KF (61%). These demonstrate that the magnitude of CL-RBE relative to IL-RBE was similar between the EF and KF (approximately 50%), regardless of the greater muscle damage for the EF than KF. It appears that the CL-RBE is more associated with neural adaptations at cerebrum, cerebellum, interhemispheric inhibition, and coricospinal tract, but the IL-RBE is induced by additional adaptations at muscles. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the etiology of running-related injuries remains elusive, possibly due to the heterogeneity of movement patterns. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether different clusters existed within a large group of injured and uninjured runners based on their kinetic gait patterns. A sample of 134 injured and uninjured runners were acquired from an existing database and 12 discrete kinetic and spatiotemporal variables which are commonly associated with running injuries were extracted from the ground reaction force waveforms. A principal components analysis followed by an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. The results revealed two distinct clusters of runners which were not associated with injury status (OR = 1.14 [0.57, 2.30], χ2 = 0.143, p = 0.706) or sex (OR = 1.72 [0.85, 3.49], χ2 = 2.3258, p = 0.127). These results suggest that while there appeared to be evidence for two distinct clusters within a large sample of injured and uninjured runners, there is no association between the kinetic variables and running related injuries. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

PMC was assessed by the pictorial scale of Perceived Movement Skill Competence for young children (PMSC). At T1, AMC was measured with Test of Gross Motor Development–third version (TGMD-3), and at T2, a shortened TGMD-3 was used. To identify the PMC-AMC profiles using latent profile analysis, the Mplus statistical package (version 8.7) was used. For aim 3, the Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (BCH) method was used. There were 480 children (mean age 6.26 years, 51.9% boys) at T1, 647 children (mean age 8.76 years, 48.8% boys) at T2 (some children were too young to have the PMC assessment at T1), and 292 at both time points. For aim 1, three profiles were identified at each time point for each gender. Boys had two realistic profiles with medium and low levels of PMC-AMC, and an overestimation profile. Girls had a medium realistic profile, an overestimation, and an underestimation profile. The PMC-AMC profile in early childhood predicted the PMC-AMC profile (aim 2) and AMC and PMC variables (aim 3) in middle childhood, especially if a child had low PMC in early childhood. Children with low PMC in early childhood are at risk of low PMC and less AMC development in middle childhood. © 2023 The Authors.

This was a cross-sectional study with data from the Encuesta Nacional de Situación Nutricional (ENSIN-2015) in Colombia, 2015–2016. The sample comprised 3002 low-income preschoolers (3–4 years old, 50.7% boys). Data on physical activity, screen time, and sleep time were collected using the Cuestionario para la Medición de Actividad Física y Comportamiento Sedentario, reported by their parents. In total, 18 potential correlates (individual, interpersonal, organizational, and community level) were analyzed. Backward binary logistic regression analysis was performed with the potential correlates as independent variables and meeting all three 24-h movement guidelines as dependent variables. The prevalence of preschoolers meeting all three 24-h movement guidelines or none was 4.8% and 16.6%, respectively. In the final model, boys (odds ratio [OR] = 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–3.50) and those who do not have television in their bedroom (OR = 2.09, 95%CI 1.05–4.14) were more likely to meet all three 24-h movement guidelines compared to with girls and those who have television, respectively. In conclusion, strategies to promote adherence to all 24-h movement guidelines among low-income preschoolers are warranted, and should focus on actions considering the importance of sex and home environment changes to support these movement behaviors. © 2023 The Authors.

Objective: The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to analyze the effect of different types of exercise on muscular fitness and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) among people with MS and to determine the best type of exercise according to disease severity. Methods: MEDLINE, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, the Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from inception to April 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the effect of physical exercise on fitness in people with MS. We ranked the types of physical exercise by calculating the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA). Results: We included 72 RCTs involving 2543 MS patients in this NMA. A ranking of five types of physical exercise (aerobic, resistance, combined [aerobic and resistance], sensorimotor training, and mind–body exercises) was achieved. Combined and resistance training had the highest effect sizes (0.94, 95% CI 0.47, 1.41, and 0.93, 95% CI 0.57, 1.29, respectively) and the highest SUCRA (86.2% and 87.0%, respectively) for muscular fitness. The highest effect size (0.66, 95% CI 0.34, 0.99) and SUCRA (86.9%) for CRF was for aerobic exercise. Conclusions: Combined and resistance training seem to be the most effective exercises to improve muscular fitness and aerobic exercise for CRF in people with MS. © 2023 The Authors.

Methods: Eighty-six adults (44 men; 34.6 ± 10.8 years) performed nine activities while simultaneously wearing GA and AG on wrist and waist. Acceleration (in gravitational equivalent units; mg) was compared with oxygen uptake (measured with indirect calorimetry). Results: Increases in acceleration mirrored increases in intensity of activities, regardless of device brand and placement. Differences in acceleration between GA and AG worn at the non-dominant wrist were small but tended to be high at lower intensity activities. Thresholds for differentiating inactivity (<1.5 MET) from activity (≥1.5 MET) ranged from 25 mg (AG non-dominant wrist; sensitivity 93%, specificity 95%) to 40 mg (AG waist; sensitivity 78%, specificity 100%). For moderate intensity (≥3 METs), thresholds ranged from 65 mg (AG waist; sensitivity 96%, specificity 94%) to 92 mg (GA non-dominant; sensitivity 93%, specificity 98%); vigorous intensity (≥6 METs) thresholds ranged from 190 mg (AG waist; sensitivity 82%, specificity 92%) to 283 mg (GA non-dominant; sensitivity 93%, specificity 98%). Conclusion: Raw triaxial acceleration outputs from two widely used accelerometer brands may have limited comparability in low intensity activities. Thresholds derived in this study can be utilized in adults to reasonably classify movement behaviors into categories of intensity. © 2023 The Authors.

Global positioning systems technology (10-Hz) was used to collect activity data during 202 competitive games from 23 elite GFR. Relative distance, peak running speed and relative distance covered in six movement categories [very low-speed movement (VLSM) (<0.70 m·s−1), walking (≥0.70–1.65 m·s−1), low-speed running (LSR) (≥1.66–3.27 m·s−1), moderate-speed running (MSR) (≥3.28–4.86 m·s−1), high-speed running (HSR) (≥4.87–6.48 m·s−1), very high-speed running (VHSR) (≥6.49 m·s−1)] were examined during the full game, first and second half, and across the four quarters. The relative distance covered was 122.6 ± 8.4 m·min−1, with 13.1 ± 4.9 m·min−1 of HSR and VHSR. The peak running speed was 6.75 ± 0.49 m·s−1. The relative (ES=0.60), MSR (ES=0.50) and HSR (ES=0.14) distance was higher in the first half than the second half. A higher relative (ES=0.62–0.91) and HSR (ES=0.51–0.61) distance was found in the first quarter than any other period. No differences in HSR distance were found between the second, third and fourth quarters (ES=0.04–0.10). This study provides, for the first time, a detailed insight into the activity profile of elite GFR during competitive games and demonstrates the demanding, intermittent nature of elite refereeing in Gaelic football.

However, only two previous studies have quantified the relative age effect (RAE; i.e., a selection bias favouring those born near the beginning of the cut-off date) in these cohorts. Additionally, no studies have explored stakeholder understanding of the RAE using qualitative methods. Aim: This study aimed to: (a) quantify the RAE in TAs and senior teams, and (b) investigate stakeholder perspectives of the talent development environment, providing practical insight into the RAE. Methods: A mixed methods sequential explanatory study design was employed. Phase one involved a retrospective analysis of longitudinal data for the frequency and distribution of births using TA (n = 12,445) and senior (n = 8,752) players. Phase two comprised two focus groups of key stakeholders [coaches (n = 4) and Talent Development Leaders (n = 4)] at TA and senior level. Results: Analysis revealed a significant difference between TA birth quarter (BQ) distributions compared with expected distributions (P < 0.001; BQ1 = 30.4% vs. BQ4 = 17.6%), whereas at senior level, there were no significant differences observed (χ2 (df = 3) = 3.812, P = 0.282). In phase two, inductive analysis revealed three higher-order themes: (a) understanding of the RAE, (b) selection criteria, and (c) player characteristics. Conclusion: The GAA are encouraged to reflect on the practice of chronological age band grouping, investigate possible solutions to limit the effects of the RAE, and offer support programmes to educate key stakeholders. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133691641,4236,0,,Excel

The most common individual movement preceding a goal was a linear advancing motion (32.4 ± 1%), followed by deceleration (20.2 ± 0.9%) and turn (19.8 ± 0.9%). Actions also involved were change in angle run (cut and arc run), ball blocking, lateral advancing motion (crossover and shuffle) and jumps. Although players followed similar trends, there were dissimilarities based on the role, with attackers (assistant and scorer) performing more linear actions, subtle turns and cuts and defenders (defender of assistant and defender of scorer) more ball blockings, lateral movements and arc runs. In 82.9 ± 1.5% of player involvements, there was at least one high intensity (HI) movement with assistant showing the lowest percentage and defender of scorer the highest. This study shows the multidirectional nature and context specificity of soccer during goal scoring situations, with linear actions such as sprints being the most common movements, followed by decelerations and turns. Moreover, it highlights the recurrent application of these at HI, and so, training strategies should prioritize the development of player’s explosiveness. © 2022 The Author(s).

A prospective comparative study. Objective. To investigate the benefits of postoperative application of lumbosacral orthosis after single-level discectomy for lumbar disk herniation (LDH). Summary of Background Data. Although many surgeons use postoperative lumbosacral orthosis for patients with LDH, there is no clear evidence to support or deny its effectiveness. Materials and Methods. Ninety-nine consecutive patients who underwent the microscopic discectomy were included. They were divided into two groups: orthosis group and nonorthosis group, before surgery. The recurrence rate and reoperation rate were compared between the two groups at four-week, six-month, and one-year follow-up. Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score for lumbar spine (L-JOA score) at two-week and one-year follow-up, lower extremities and low back pain's visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at six-month and one-year follow-up were compared. Results. Forty-two patients in the orthosis group and 39 patients in the nonorthosis group were followed up for at least one-year after surgery. Recurrence occurred in three patients (7.1%) in the orthosis group and six (15.4%) in the nonorthosis group within one-year. Two patients (4.8%) in the orthosis group and two patients (5.1%) in the nonorthosis group underwent reoperation. There were no significant intergroup differences in the recurrence rate and in the reoperation rate. No significant difference was also observed between the two groups in L-JOA score, ODI, VAS of low back pain, and leg pain at one-year after surgery. Furthermore, at any other follow-up period, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in recurrence rate, reoperation rate, L-JOA score, VAS of low back/leg pain, or ODI. Conclusions. The use of a postoperative orthosis did not reduce recurrence or reoperation rates, nor did it improve postoperative clinical symptoms. The routine use of an orthosis may not be necessary after single-level lumbar discectomy. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A functional, transcriptome, and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression analysis in the spinal cord of mice after hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment. Objective. We aimed to explore the mechanism by which HBO treats spinal cord injury (SCI) at the level of lncRNAs. Summary of Background Data. Immense amounts of research have established that HBO treatment promotes the recovery of neurological function after SCI. The mechanism of action remains to be clarified. Methods. High-throughput RNA sequencing, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were used to profile lncRNA expression and analyze biological function in the spinal cords of mice from sham-operated, SCI, and HBO-treated groups. The differential expression of lncRNA between the groups was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results. Differential expression across 577 lncRNAs was identified among the three groups. GO analysis showed that free ubiquitin chain polymerization, ubiquitin homeostasis, DNA replication, synthesis of RNA primer, single-stranded telomeric DNA binding, and alpha-amylase activity were significantly enriched. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis displayed that vitamin B6 metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, DNA replication, lysine degradation, beta-alanine metabolism, fanconi anemia pathway, and Notch signal pathway were the main pathways with enrichment significance. LncRNAs NONMMUT 092674.1, NONMMUT042986.2, and NONMMUT018850.2 showed significantly different expression between the SCI and the other two groups (P<0.05, <0.01). Conclusions. This study is the first to determine the expression profiles of lncRNAs in the injured spinal cord after HBO treatment. We identified several important dysregulated lncRNAs in this setting. These results help us better understand the mechanism by which HBO treats SCI and provide new potential therapeutic targets for SCI. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Objective: This study aims to explore, in rodent models, the effectiveness of systemic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in reducing recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) induced neuroinflammation. Summary of Background Data: rhBMP-2 is increasingly used to augment fusion in lumbar interbody fusion surgeries, although it can cause complications including postoperative radiculitis. Materials and Methods: Eighteen 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats underwent Hargreaves testing to measure the baseline thermal withdrawal threshold before undergoing surgical intervention. The L5 nerve root was exposed and wrapped with an Absorbable Collagen Sponge containing rhBMP-2. Rats were randomized into 3 groups: (1) Low dose (LD), (2) high dose (HD) diclofenac sodium, and (3) saline, receiving daily injection treatment. Hargreaves testing was performed postoperatively on days 5 and 7. Seroma volumes were measured by aspiration and the nerve root was then harvested for hematoxylin and eosin, immunohistochemistry, Luxol Fast Blue staining, and real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The Student t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance among groups. Results: The intervention groups showed reduced seroma volume, and a general reduction of inflammatory markers (MMP12, MAPK6, GFAP, CD68, and IL18) compared with controls, with the reduction in MMP12 being statistically significant (P = 0.02). Hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry of the nerve roots showed the highest macrophage density in the saline controls and the lowest in the HD group. Luxol Fast Blue staining showed the greatest extent of demyelination in the LD and saline groups. Lastly, Hargreaves testing, a functional measure of neuroinflammation, of the HD group demonstrated a minimal change in thermal withdrawal latency. In contrast, the thermal withdrawal latency of the LD and saline groups showed a statistically significant decrease of 35.2% and 28.0%, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This is the first proof-of-concept study indicating that diclofenac sodium is effective in alleviating rhBMP-2-induced neuroinflammation. This can potentially impact the clinical management of rhBMP-2-induced radiculitis. It also presents a viable rodent model for evaluating the effectiveness of analgesics in reducing rhBMP-2-induced inflammation. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Prospective cohort study. Objective. This study determined (1) the surgeon accuracy of psychological assessment in patients in spine clinic, (2) the impact of psychological distress on surgical recommendation, and (3) the correlation between patient-reported disability and psychological distress. Summary of Background Data. Psychological distress is common among patients presenting for spine surgery. Surgeon estimations of patients' distress may influence treatment recommendations, but little is known as to whether these assessments accurately mirror patient-perceived psychological distress. Materials and Methods. A sample of new patients was recruited from an academic spine center. Prior to their initial consultation, patients completed the Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire and Zung Depression Index to assess mental and physical manifestations of distress, which generated a Distress and Risk Assessment Method (DRAM) score of N (normal), R (at risk), or D (distressed). The Oswestry Disability Index and Neck Disability Index scores were also collected. Surgeons provided their estimates of the DRAM score after the visit and indicated their surgery recommendation. Results. Of 296 patients, 40.5% reported some level of psychological distress (DRAM=R) and 15.9% had a high level of distress (DRAM=D). All three surgeons' ability to accurately assess the participant DRAM score was poor, with an overall kappa of 0.13 (0.08-0.18), biased toward underestimating the patient's true level of psychological distress. Patients rated as normal (N) by the surgeon were 3.78 times more likely to be recommended for surgery compared to those assessed as distressed (D) (P=0.007). Patients with higher DRAM scores had higher Oswestry Disability Index (P=0.008) and Neck Disability Index (P=0.005) scores compared to those with lower DRAM scores. Conclusions. Spine surgeons have limited ability to detect psychological profiles in patients, with a tendency to underestimate levels of distress. The finding that these inaccurate assessments influence surgical recommendations underscores the importance of limiting surgeon bias in the decision-making process. Level of Evidence.

Retrospective cohort. Objective. Compare the performance of and provide cutoff values for commonly used prognostic models for spinal metastases, including Revised Tokuhashi, Tomita, Modified Bauer, New England Spinal Metastases Score (NESMS), and Skeletal Oncology Research Group model, at three- and six-month postoperative time points. Summary of Background Data. Surgery may be recommended for patients with spinal metastases causing fracture, instability, pain, and/or neurological compromise. However, patients with less than three to six months of projected survival are less likely to benefit from surgery. Prognostic models have been developed to help determine prognosis and surgical candidacy. Yet, there is a lack of data directly comparing the performance of these models at clinically relevant time points or providing clinically applicable cutoff values for the models. Materials and Methods. Sixty-four patients undergoing surgery from 2015 to 2022 for spinal metastatic disease were identified. Revised Tokuhashi, Tomita, Modified Bauer, NESMS, and Skeletal Oncology Research Group were calculated for each patient. Model calibration and discrimination for predicting survival at three months, six months, and final follow-up were evaluated using the Brier score and Uno's C, respectively. Hazard ratios for survival were calculated for the models. The Contral and O'Quigley method was utilized to identify cutoff values for the models discriminating between survival and nonsurvival at three months, six months, and final follow-up. Results. Each of the models demonstrated similar performance in predicting survival at three months, six months, and final follow-up. Cutoff scores that best differentiated patients likely to survive beyond three months included the Revised Tokuhashi score=10, Tomita score=four, Modified Bauer score=three, and NESMS=one. Conclusion. We found comparable efficacy among the models in predicting survival at clinically relevant time points. Cutoff values provided herein may assist surgeons and patients when deciding whether to pursue surgery for spinal metastatic disease. Level of Evidence. 4. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data. Objective. The purposes of this study were to (1) assess disparities in relative utilization of outpatient cervical spine surgery between White and Black patients from 2010 to 2019 and (2) to measure how these racial differences have evolved over time. Summary of Background Data. Although outpatient spine surgery has become increasingly popularized over the last decade, it remains unknown how racial disparities in surgical utilization have translated to the outpatient setting and whether restrictive patterns of access to outpatient cervical spine procedures may exist. Methods. A retrospective cohort study from 2010 to 2019 was conducted using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Relative utilization of outpatient (same-day discharge) for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (OP-ACDF) and cervical disk replacement (OP-CDR) were assessed and trended over time between races. Multivariable regressions were subsequently utilized to adjust for baseline patient factors and comorbidities. Results. Overall, Black patients were significantly less likely to undergo OP-ACDF or OP-CDR surgery when compared with White patients (P<0.03 for both OP-ACDF and OP-CDR). From 2010 to 2019, a persisting disparity over time was found in outpatient utilization for both ACDF and CDR (e.g. White vs. Black OP-ACDF: 6.0% vs. 3.1% in 2010 compared with 16.7% vs. 8.5% in 2019). These results held in all adjusted analyses. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting racial disparities in outpatient spine surgery and demonstrates an emerging disparity in outpatient cervical spine utilization among Black patients. These restrictive patterns of access to same-day outpatient hospital and surgery centers may contribute to broader disparities in the overall utilization of major spine procedures that have been previously reported. Renewed interventions are needed to both understand and address these emerging inequalities in outpatient care before they become more firmly established within our orthopedic and neurosurgery spine delivery systems. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Retrospective cross-sectional review of a large database Objective. Little is known regarding extension K-lines for treatment of cervical myelopathy. Therefore, this study seeks to examine differences between K-lines drawn in neutral and extension. Summary of Background Data. The modified K-line is a radiological tool used in surgical planning of the cervical spine. As posterior cervical decompression and fusion often results in patients being fused in a more lordotic position than the preoperative neutral radiograph, a K-line measured in the extension position may offer better utility for these patients. Materials and Methods. Total of 97 patients were selected with T2-weighted, upright cervical magnetic resonance imaging taken in neutral and extension. For each patient, the K-line was drawn at the mid-sagittal position for both neutral and extension. The distance from the most posterior portion of each disk (between C2 and C7) to the K-line was measured in neutral and extension and the difference was calculated. Paired t test was used to assess significant differences. Results. Across all levels between C2 and C7 there was an increase in the distance between the dorsal aspect of the disk and K-line when comparing neutral and extension radiographs. The average change in difference (extension minus neutral) at each cervical spinal level was 0.9 mm (C2-C3), 2.5 mm (C3-C4), 2.6 mm (C4-C5), 2.0 mm (C5-C6), and 0.9 mm (C6-C7). A paired t test showed that the K-line increase from neutral to extension was statistically significant across all disk levels (P<0.001). Conclusion. When positioned in extension, patients experience a significant increase in distance from the dorsal aspect of a disk to the K-line compared to when positioned in neutral, especially between C3 and C6. This is clinically relevant for surgeons considering a posterior cervical decompression and fusion in patients with a negative modified K-line on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, as these patients may have enough cervical cord drift back when fused in an extended position, maximizing likelihood of improving postoperative DSM functional outcomes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Prospective comparative study. Objective. The objective of this study was to investigate perioperative cardiac function using echocardiography in patients undergoing surgery for the adult spinal deformity (ASD). Summary of Background Data. Corrective surgery for ASD has increased, especially in older persons. However, perioperative complication rates remain high in ASD surgery, including cardiopulmonary complications. Materials and Methods. This study included patients with ASD who underwent surgery between May 2016 and April 2018. A cardiologist performed all echocardiography imaging preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively. Left ventricular contractility was measured using left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and right ventricular contractility was measured using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and tricuspid annular peak systolic velocity (S'). Spinopelvic radiographic parameters, the apices of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis, and the inflection point where the vertebral curvature changes from kyphosis to lordosis were also measured. Differences between preoperative and postoperative measurements for continuous variables were analyzed using a paired Student t test. Differences in continuous and categorical variables between two independent groups were analyzed using an unpaired Student t test and Fisher exact test, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to detect influential factors. Results. Sixty-one patients were included [12 males and 49 females; average age, 64.0 (22-84) yr]. LVEF, TAPSE, and S', respectively changed from 64.4%, 24.9 mm, and 14.3 cm/s to 65.4%, 25 mm, and 15 cm/s postoperatively with no significance. However, in LVEF<59.3% (average-1 SD), TAPSE<17 mm, and S'<11.8 cm/s cases, respectively, these increased significantly from 55.7%, 17.9 mm, and 10.5 cm/s to 60.9%, 21.4 mm, and 14.2 cm/s postoperatively (P=0.036, 0.029, and 0.022, respectively). The LVEF<59.3% group showed a significantly lower inflection point level (1.5 vs. 2.9) preoperatively (P=0.007). The S'<11.8 cm/s group showed significantly larger thoracic kyphosis (28.3° vs. 19.4°) preoperatively (P=0.013). Conclusions. Perioperative cardiac function did not deteriorate after surgery in patients with ASD. In those with lower cardiac function preoperatively, there were significant improvements noted postoperatively. The preoperative inflection point level was significantly lower in the lower LVEF group. Preoperative thoracic kyphosis was significantly larger in the lower tricuspid annular peak systolic velocity group. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A retrospective cohort study. Objective. To assess whether patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery have improved over the past decade. Background. Surgery for ASD is an effective intervention, but one that is also associated with large initial healthcare expenditures. Changes in the cost profile for ASD surgery over the last decade has not been evaluated previously. Materials and Methods. ASD patients who received surgery between 2008 and 2019 were included. Analysis of covariance was used to establish estimated marginal means for outcome measures [complication rates, reoperations, health-related quality of life, total cost, utility gained, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), cost-efficiency (cost per QALY)] by year of initial surgery. Cost was calculated using the PearlDiver database and represented national averages of Medicare reimbursement for services within a 30-day window including length of stay and death differentiated by complication/comorbidity, revision, and surgical approach. Internal cost data was based on individual patient diagnosis-related group codes, limiting revisions to those within two years (2Y) of the initial surgery. Cost per QALY over the course of 2008-2019 were then calculated. Results. There were 1236 patients included. There was an overall decrease in rates of any complication (0.78 vs. 0.61), any reoperation (0.25 vs. 0.10), and minor complication (0.54 vs. 0.37) between 2009 and 2018 (all P<0.05). National average 2Y cost decreased at an annual rate of $3194 (R 2=0.6602), 2Y utility gained increased at an annual rate of 0.0041 (R 2=0.57), 2Y QALYs gained increased annually by 0.008 (R 2=0.57), and 2Y cost per QALY decreased per year by $39,953 (R 2=0.6778). Conclusion. Between 2008 and 2019, rates of complications have decreased concurrently with improvements in patient reported outcomes, resulting in improved cost effectiveness according to national Medicare average and individual patient cost data. The value of ASD surgery has improved substantially over the course of the last decade. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145955339,4464,0,,"SPSS, Excel"

Retrospective cohort study. Objective. The purpose of this study was to characterize the infection risk of preoperative epidural steroid injection (ESI) in patients undergoing posterior cervical surgery. Summary of Background Data. ESI is a helpful tool for alleviating pain and is often used as a diagnostic tool before cervical surgery. However, a recent small-scale study found that ESI before cervical fusion was associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection. Materials and Methods. Patients from 2010 to 2020 with cervical myelopathy, spondylosis, and radiculopathy who underwent posterior cervical procedure including laminectomy, laminoforaminotomy, fusion, or laminoplasty were queried from the PearlDiver database. Patients who underwent revision or fusion above C2 or who had a diagnosis of neoplasm, trauma, or preexisting infection were excluded. Patients were divided on whether they received an ESI within 30 days before the procedure and subsequently matched by age, sex, and preoperative comorbidities. The χ2analysis was used to calculate the risk of postoperative infection within 90 days. Logistic regression controlling for age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and operated levels was conducted within the unmatched population to assess infection risk for injected patients across procedure subgroups. Results. Overall, 299,417 patients were identified with 3897 having received a preoperative ESI and 295,520 who did not. Matching resulted in 975 in the injected group and 1929 in the control group. There was no significant difference in postoperative infection rate in those who received an ESI within 30 days preoperatively and those who did not (3.28% vs. 3.78%, odds ratio=0.86, 95% CI: 0.57-1.32, P=0.494). Logistic regression accounting for age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and levels operated demonstrated that injection did not significantly increase infection risk in any of the procedure subgroups. Conclusions. The present study found no association between preoperative ESI within 30 days before surgery and postoperative infection in patients undergoing posterior cervical surgery. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The main challenge was to clarify if SpM patients presenting poor ECOG-PS could benefit from a surgical intervention. Background. Spine metastases (SpM) are debilitating lesions commonly found in the evolution of cancer. At present, patients with poor ECOG-PS do not benefit from surgical care. Materials and Methods. Between 2014 and 2017, 176 SpM patients with poor initial ECOG-PS (3 or 4) were identified. Results. The median overall survival of patients was 2.1 months (SD 0.2). Seventy-one patients (40.3%) underwent surgery: for 49 patients (27.8%) the intervention consisted of a simple decompression and for 22 patients (12.5%) the previous was associated with an osteosynthesis. Patients who underwent surgery demonstrated significantly longer median overall survival than those who did not: 3.5 months (SD 0.4) versus 1.6 (SD 0.2) (P<0.0001). No significant differences between operated/nonoperated patients were noted concerning median age (66.4 vs. 64.2 y, P=0.897), the median number of SpM (4.1 vs. 4.2, P=0.374), ECOG-PS 4 ratio (41.6 vs. 39.3%, P=0.616), or for primary tumors (P=0.103). Patients who underwent surgery statistically improved their neurological impairment according to the Frankel score: 5/11 (45.4%) from A to C, 5/17 (29.4%) from B to C or D, 6/11 (54.5%) from C to D and 2/4 (50%). Twelve patients (16.9%) presented a postoperative complication. Conclusion. Patients with poor ECOG-PS could benefit from surgery. Even though survival gain is small, it permits the preservation of their neurological function. By making ambulation possible, pain is decreased during the last months of their lives.

Objective: To identify hub genes related to bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) and analyze their functional characteristics. Summary of Background Data: The exact etiology and pathologic mechanism of OLF remain unclear. BMPs are pleiotropic osteoinductive proteins that may play a critical role in this condition. Materials and Methods: The GSE106253 and GSE106256 data sets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA expression profiles were obtained from GSE106253. The microRNA expression profiles were obtained from GSE106256. Differentially expressed genes were identified between OLF and non-OLF groups and then intersected with BMP-related genes to obtain differentially expressed BMP-related genes. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator and support vector machine recursive feature elimination were used to screen hub genes. Furthermore, a competing endogenous RNA network was constructed to explain the expression regulation of the hub genes in OLF. Finally, the protein and mRNA expression levels of the hub genes were verified using Western blot and real-Time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: We identified 671 Differentially expressed genes and 32 differentially expressed BMP-related genes. Hub genes ADIPOQ, SCD, SCX, RPS18, WDR82, and SPON1, identified through the least absolute shrinkage selection operator and support vector machine recursive feature elimination analyses, showed high diagnostic values for OLF. Furthermore, the competing endogenous RNA network revealed the regulatory mechanisms of the hub genes. Real-Time polymerase chain reaction showed that the mRNA expression of the hub genes was significantly downregulated in the OLF group compared with the non-OLF group. Western blot showed that the protein levels of ADIPOQ, SCD, WDR82, and SPON1 were significantly downregulated, whereas those of SCX and RPS18 were significantly upregulated in the OLF group compared with the non-OLF group. Conclusion: This study is the first to identify BMP-related genes in OLF pathogenesis through bioinformatics analysis. ADIPOQ, SCD, SCX, RPS18, WDR82, and SPON1 were identified as hub genes for OLF. The identified genes may serve as potential therapeutic targets for treating patients with OLF. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

I utilize a multilevel analysis to map how activism is rendered counter-hegemonic, non-normative behavior in college sport through barriers manifesting at the macro-level (societal), meso-level (organizational), and micro-level (individual). Barriers at the macro-level include social norms prioritizing athlete identity and stigma attached to activism, while barriers at the meso-level include the strict regulation of athletes’ lives, isolation on campus, team cultural norms, and institutional power relations. Finally, emotional exhaustion and lack of rapport with peers manifested at the micro-level, further constituting barriers to activist efforts. The complex interplay of barriers at multiple levels, I argue, perpetuates a hegemonic order where contemporary collegiate athlete activists and the arena of sport become sites for the struggle for power–that is, cultural sites in which the battle between hegemonic forces and agents of resistance becomes manifested and visible. © 2023 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149494159,4550,0,,

Methods: Literature searches in the PubMed, SCOPUS and SPORTDiscus databases identified a total of 15 studies that measured muscle hypertrophy (in healthy adults of any age and resistance training experience) and compared resistance training performed to: (A) momentary muscular failure versus non-failure; (B) set failure (defined as anything other than momentary muscular failure) versus non-failure; or (C) different velocity loss thresholds. Results: There was a trivial advantage for resistance training performed to set failure versus non-failure for muscle hypertrophy in studies applying any definition of set failure [effect size=0.19 (95% confidence interval 0.00, 0.37), p=0.045], with no moderating effect of volume load (p=0.884) or relative load (p=0.525). Given the variability in set failure definitions applied across studies, sub-group analyses were conducted and found no advantage for either resistance training performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure for muscle hypertrophy [effect size=0.12 (95% confidence interval −0.13, 0.37), p=0.343], or for resistance training performed to high (>25%) versus moderate (20–25%) velocity loss thresholds [effect size=0.08 (95% confidence interval −0.16, 0.32), p=0.529]. Conclusion: Overall, our main findings suggest that (i) there is no evidence to support that resistance training performed to momentary muscular failure is superior to non-failure resistance training for muscle hypertrophy and (ii) higher velocity loss thresholds, and theoretically closer proximities-to-failure do not always elicit greater muscle hypertrophy. As such, these results provide evidence for a potential non-linear relationship between proximity-to-failure and muscle hypertrophy. © 2022, The Author(s).",Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141384715,4615,0,,R

Objective: The objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of chronic resistance training on range of motion compared either to a control condition or stretch training or to a combination of resistance training and stretch training to stretch training, while assessing moderating variables. Design: For the main analysis, a random-effect meta-analysis was used and for the subgroup analysis a mixed-effect model was implemented. Whilst subgroup analyses included sex and participants’ activity levels, meta-regression included age, frequency, and duration of resistance training. Data Sources: Following the systematic search in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and reference lists, 55 studies were found to be eligible. Eligibility Criteria: Controlled or randomized controlled trials that separately compared the training effects of resistance training exercises with either a control group, stretching group, or combined stretch and resistance training group on range of motion in healthy participants. Results: Resistance training increased range of motion (effect size [ES] = 0.73; p < 0.001) with the exception of no significant range of motion improvement with resistance training using only body mass. There were no significant differences between resistance training versus stretch training (ES = 0.08; p = 0.79) or between resistance training and stretch training versus stretch training alone (ES = − 0.001; p = 0.99). Although “trained or active people” increased range of motion (ES = 0.43; p < 0.001) “untrained and sedentary” individuals had significantly (p = 0.005) higher magnitude range of motion changes (ES = 1.042; p < 0.001). There were no detected differences between sex and contraction type. Meta-regression showed no effect of age, training duration, or frequency. Conclusions: As resistance training with external loads can improve range of motion, stretching prior to or after resistance training may not be necessary to enhance flexibility. © 2023, The Author(s).",Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145925240,4602,0,,

One reason of potentially several is that subjective monitoring affords athletes to give dishonest responses. Indeed, athletes have never been systematically researched to understand why they are honest or not. Objective: Because we do not know what motivates professional athletes to be honest or not when responding to subjective monitoring, our objective is to explore the motives for why the athlete may or may not respond honestly. Methods: A qualitative and phenomenological approach was used, interviewing 11 world-class team-sport athletes (five women, six men) about their experiences when asked to respond to subjective monitoring questionnaires. Interview transcripts were read in full and significant quotations/statements extracted. Meanings were formulated for each interviewees’ story and assigned codes. Codes were reflected upon and labelled as categories, with similar categories grouped into an overall theme. Themes were examined, articulated, re-interpreted, re-formulated, and written as a thematic story, drawing on elements reported from different athletes creating a blended story, allowing readers a feel for what it is like to live the experience. Results: Overall, four key themes emerged: (i) pursuit of the ideal-self, (ii) individual barriers to athlete engagement, (iii) social facilitators to athlete engagement; and (iv) feeling compassion from performance staff. Conclusions: Our main insight is that athletes’ emotions play a major role in whether they respond honestly or not, with these emotions being driven at least in part by the performance staff asking the questions. © 2023, The Author(s).",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147747370,4594,0,,

A secondary aim was to compare clinical and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) between the designs. METHODS: A total of 61 TKAs were analyzed in this randomized clinical RSA trial. RSA examinations were performed one day and three, six, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. The maximal total point motion (MPTM), translations, and rotations of the components were analyzed. PROMs and clinical data were collected preoperatively and at six weeks and three, six, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Linear mixed effect modelling was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The mean MTPM two years postoperatively (95% confidence interval (CI)) of the Attune femoral component (0.92 mm (0.75 to 1.11)) differed significantly from that of the LCS TKA (1.72 mm (1.47 to 2.00), p < 0.001). The Attune femoral component subsided, tilted (anteroposteriorly), and rotated (internal-external) significantly less. The mean tibial MTPM two years postoperatively did not differ significantly, being 1.11 mm (0.94 to 1.30) and 1.17 mm (0.99 to 1.36, p = 0.447) for the Attune and LCS components, respectively. The rate of migration in the second postoperative year was negligible for the femoral and tibial components of both designs. The mean pain-at-rest (numerical rating scale (NRS)-rest) in the Attune group was significantly less compared with that in the LCS group during the entire follow-up period. At three months postoperatively, the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Physical Function Shortform score, the Oxford Knee Score, and the NRS-activity scores were significantly better in the Attune group. CONCLUSION: The mean MTPM of the femoral components of the cementless rotating platform Attune was significantly less compared with that of the LCS design. This was reflected mainly in significantly less subsidence, posterior tilting, and internal rotation. The mean tibial MTPMs were not significantly different. During the second postoperative year, the components of both designs stabilized and low risks for the development of aseptic loosening are expected.Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2023;105-B(2):148-157.",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147187157,774,0,,R
